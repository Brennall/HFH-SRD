# Chapter 7: Heroic Treasure

*Everywhere, by the light of opulent lamps, they beheld inestimable and miraculous treasures. There were tables of ebony wrought with sorcerous runes of pearl and white coral; webs of silver and samite, cunningly pictured; caskets of electrum overflowing with talismanic jewels; tiny gods of jade and agate; and tall chryselephantine demons. Here was the loot of ages, lying heaped and mingled in utter negligence, without lock or ward, as if free for any casual thief.* – The Death of Malygris (C.A. Smith)

## Treasure Type

Treasure - the wage of heroes! A dragon’s or evil sorcerer-king’s hoard will lay glimmering in the torchlight, coin in uncountable volume like the sands of the desert. Sprinkled among the coin will be goods from exotic lands, trophies of monsters and victories won, and possibly even items of legendary power. Bold adventurers may carry off a few choice items and precious metals, but few parties could plunder the full hoard unless they’ve brought an army. To better reflect these genre tropes, the Treasure Type tables have been substantially adjusted for the *Heroic Fantasy Handbook*.

### Coin

In the ACKS core rules, low-level hoards consisted mostly of common coin (cp and sp), while high-level hoards consisted mostly of precious coin (gp and pp). In the Heroic Fantasy Handbook, all hoards consist mostly of common coin, with high-level hoards consisting of a lot of common coin with moderate amounts of precious coin. As a result, treasure hoards are now considerably larger in total bulk than those in the core rules. For instance, a dragon hoard (TT R) in the core rules would typically contain 1750sp, 2100gp, and 3600pp. The same hoard using these rules would typically contain 19600cp, 14000sp, 5600ep, 4000gp, and 2625pp. The first hoard weighs 7.5 stone and is worth 20,275gp. The second hoard is seven times bigger (46 stone) but worth only a bit more (21,525gp). Rarer coin can still be placed as Special Treasure (see below), however.

### Special Treasure

Ancient cities hold terracotta pottery or rare dyes and pigments. The tombs of ancient kings have trinkets of carved ivory and ostrich plumes dipped in gold. Goblin raiders have captured spices, silk, or rare furs, or even human prisoners! These items are collectively called special treasures.

First introduced in ACKS, the special treasure rules allow the Judge to introduce rewards beyond coin, gems, and jewelry. To include special treasures in a hoard, first calculate the treasure normally and divide it into lots: 1 piece of jewelry, 1 gem, or 1,000 coins is a lot. Then choose or roll on the table below for each lot of coin, gems, and jewelry and substitute the special treasure rolled for that lot. As always the Judge should feel free to disregard an inappropriate random result and select something more sensible!

Note that the Special Treasure tables below have been updated from those found in ACKS in order to include new trade goods, equipment, herbs, and so on. Where captives or slave values are given, this will represent either the reward earned from rescuing a captive, or the price earned from selling a slave, depending on the type of heroic fantasy setting.

## Magic Item Descriptions

### Armor, Swords, and Weapons

#### Types of Armor, Swords, and Weapons Found

In most cases, the entries for armor, swords, and weapons on the Magic Item tables do not specify the exact item found. A suit of armor might be hide, ring, or plate; a sword might be a short sword or a two-handed sword; a miscellaneous weapon might be a battle axe or spear or a warhammer. What is found will depend on the source of the treasure. The Judge can use the tables below to guide placement of appropriate armors, swords, and weapons in his treasure hoards based on the campaign setting and treasure source.

The categories used in these tables are described below. The Judge should feel free to modify these tables or create his own that match his particular campaign settings. Many interesting possibilities presented by history have been excluded simply due to the limits of space.

**Ancient Myth:** For campaigns set in an ersatz Mesopotamian and Mediterranean Bronze or Iron Age civilization, such as Sumeria, Babylonia, Scythia, or Mycenae. Armor tends to be laminated cloth (leather), leather scale, Sumerian overlapping bronze plate (banded), or early bronze panoply (plate). Gladiator armors are included to represent partial armor sets of the next higher tier. Common weapons in these ancient days include the composite bow, javelin, mace, short sword, and spear. In the Auran Empire setting, treasures from the Ancient Argollëan, Thrassian, and Zaharan civilizations, and from contemporary Kemesh, would use these entries.

**Classical Epic:** For campaigns inspired by Greco-Roman, Zoroastrian Persian, or Byzantine civilization or sword-and-sandal fiction. Armor might be linothorax (leather), leather scale, Celtic mail or Roman lorica hamata (chain), Roman lorica squamata (scale), Roman lorica segmentata (banded), Byzantine or Persian lamellar, or Greek classical panoply (plate). Gladiator armors are included to represent both actual gladiator apparel and partial armor sets. Common weapons include composite bows; lances such as the kontos and xyston; pole arms such as the falx and sarissa; short swords such as the gladius, kopis, and xiphos; spears such as the doru; and swords such as the spatha. In the Auran Empire setting, these entries would apply to treasures from the Classical Auran civilization and the current Imperial one.

**Northern Saga:** For campaigns similar to the world described in the Old Norse and Icelandic epics and the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, or historical Iron Age Germany or Viking Age Scandinavia. Armor will include furs, hardened leather, Frankish ring armor, leather scale, chainmail byrnies, and limited plate-and-mail. Common weapons include the battle axe, great axe, seax (dagger), spear, sword, and warhammer. In the Auran Empire setting, treasures from the Kingdoms of Jutland and Rorn would use these entries.

**Chivalric Romance:** For campaigns inspired by the 11th to 13th century chansons de geste, such as the Matter of France or Matter of Britain and the later chivalric romances of the 13th and 14th centuries. Armor might be cuir bouilli (leather), ring armor, leather scale, Norman mail hauberks, brigandine (lamellar), and plate-and-mail. Common weapons include the couched lance, great sword, horseman’s flail, longbow, knightly sword, mace, morning star, and various pole arms such as the halberd, glaive, and pike. This time period post-dates the Auran Empire setting, but is very common in other fantasy game settings.

**Arabian Adventure:** For campaigns drawing on the late Byzantine and Persian Empires, the medieval Crusades, the Islamic Golden Age, and the folk lore of One Thousand and One Nights. Armor might be silk, leather, ring, leather scale, Crusader mail, eastern lamellar, or mirror armor (plate). Common weapons include the composite bow, lance, mace, spear, and various curved swords such as the scimitar, shamshir, and tulwar. In the Auran Empire, these entries could be used for contemporary Opelenean, Somirean, Skysos, and Celdorean treasures.

**High Fantasy:** For campaigns inspired by Tolkienesque heroic fantasy in the pseudo-medieval tradition, including The Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance, Game of Thrones, The Deed of Paksenarrion, and most other popular fantasy of the last few decades. The armor and weapons tend to be similar to those used in the High Middle Ages .

**Sword & Sorcery:** For campaigns inspired by Howardian heroic fantasy in the pulp tradition, including Conan, Kull, Thongor, Kothar, and other works. The armor and weapons tend to be a hodgepodge of the ancient, classical, medieval, exotic, and purely fantastical.

#### Powers of Armor, Swords, and Weapons Found

Magical weapons and armor follow the same class restrictions as all normal weapons and armor. When armor has a bonus, it will improve the AC and reduce the encumbrance (to a minimum of 0) by the amount specified. For example, leather armor +1 would grant AC 3 with an encumbrance of 1. Masterwork armor provides a +1 bonus to armor class, but does not decrease encumbrance.

When a sword or other weapon has a plus, such as a dagger +1, this means that attack throws and damage rolls both receive a +1 bonus. Masterwork weapons grant a +1 bonus to attack throws and damage, but cannot affect creatures which can only be harmed by magic. If a weapon has more than one bonus listed, the first bonus applies to all attacks and damage, and the second applies only to an exclusive group of creatures. If the weapon’s entry does not specify which group of creatures the secondary bonus applies to, the Judge can choose or roll for the creatures affected on the table below.

|Roll 1d20|	Type|	|Roll 1d20|	Type

|1	|Animals*|	|11	|Men
|2	|Avians*|	|12	|Lycanthropes

|9	|Elves, Faeries, & Nymphs|	|19	|Undead
|10	|Giant Humanoids|	|20	|Vermin*
*Including normal and giant creatures of this type, but not sentient creatures

**Items of Proficiency:** Some magical shields, swords, or weapons grant their wielder access to one or more proficiencies. The Judge can choose or roll for the proficiency granted by the item on the tables below.

Items of proficiency can be activated three times per day (3/day). When activated, items of proficiency grant their wielder the proficiency for one hour, or until the wearer drops the item or the effect is dispelled. This effect is worth 6,000gp (it’s effectively a 1st level spell 3/day). Some legendary items, such as the bow of the great eagles, grant proficiencies whenever they are wielded, without requiring activation. As permanent powers, these effect cannot be dispelled, but are much more expensive to enchant!

#### Naming Armors and Armor (Optional)

When creating a magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor, its creator must give the item a name. Only those who confidently speak the name of the item receive the full benefit of its powers. If a character is unsure of an item’s name, he may guess once; if incorrect, he may not guess again until reaching a higher level of experience.

Alternatively, when an item is found, it may be given a new name by its wielder or wearer. Upon first naming the item, the character receives the benefit of one of its bonuses in one category (e.g. +1 to hit, +1 to damage, +1 to AC, -1 to encumbrance) or of a special power or ceremonial spell. With each level of experience earned wielding or wearing his re-named item, the character unlocks an additional point of bonus in one category, until all bonuses in all categories are unlocked. The Judge makes the determination of the order in which the item’s powers unlock.

EXAMPLE: In the tomb of Durin Blackfist, Raknar discovers an ancient war hammer, gleaming and rune-carved. He decides this must be Durin’s hammer Fist of Iron and announces such. In battle, the war hammer reveals itself a +3 weapon – Raknar was right! <br>
Like a true Jutland hero, Raknar dies fighting, his body sprawled on a mound of orc corpses. Later, a young 1st level fighter named Marcus finds the rune-carved war hammer. Knowing it to be magical, but not having any idea of its origin, he names the hammer Tooth-Breaker. In his next fight, Marcus gets a +1 bonus to damage from Tooth-breaker. When he reaches 2nd level, Marcus finds that Tooth-Breaker is +1 to hit and damage. When he is 3rd level, it becomes +1 to hit and +2 to damage, and so on, until at 6th level it reaches its full power of +3 to hit and damage. <br>
But what if Marcus were slain at 4th level, after unlocking Fist of Iron / Tooth-Breaker’s powers to the level of +2 to hit and +2 to damage? Assume his henchman, Peristo, now claims Tooth-Breaker. It is a +2 weapon in his hands. When Peristo gains a level, Tooth-Breaker will become +2 to hit and +3 to damage. If Peristo were to discover that this weapon is also Fist of Iron, it would immediately reach its full +3 powers.

#### Armor, Sword, and Weapon Descriptions

**Armor of the Invincible Conqueror:** According to legend, the hero Valerian Bellësareus wore the armor of the invincible conqueror during his duel with his brother, the ruinguard Acherib, at the height of the Empyrean War. Crafted of gleaming orichalcum, this suit of archaic plate armor +3 grants its wearer complete protection from normal, non-magical attacks. Magic or silver weapons can harm the wearer, but any number of normal swords, arrows, clubs, or natural weapons will be fended off. Monsters which themselves can only be affected by silver or magical weapons can still harm the subject, and monsters with 5 HD or more are able to affect the subject through natural ferocity. Value: 160,000gp (+3 enchantment, 5th level permanent effect).

**Bow of the Great Eagles:** The legendary bow of the great eagles is an elven composite bow +3 crafted of laminated dawn redwood with bow-limbs carved to resemble eagle’s talons. The elvish general Aedon Lann is credited with killing more than 500 orcs with the bow during the Beastman Wars of the Third Century B.E. Anytime an arrow is nocked on the bow’s string, the bow’s wielder gains precise shooting (as the proficiency), allowing him to fire at engaged targets with a -4 penalty, and eyes of the eagle (as the spell), allowing him to see 100 times further than normal and reducing the wielder’s penalty for missile attacks with the bow at medium range to -1 and at long range to -2. Once per day, if the wielder fires an arrow into the sky, the bow will call a large roc to server the wielder (as the spell call of the giant eagle). If a character who already possesses one or more ranks of Precise Shooting wields the bow, its granted proficiency stacks with his natural ranks. Value: 160,000gp (+3 enchantment, 5th level daily effect, 3rd level permanent effect, 1st level permanent effect).

**Bow of the Unconquered Sun:** A relic of the Empyrean War, the bow of the unconquered sun is a composite bow crafted of laminated dawn redwood and trimmed in golden orichalcum. It grants its wielder two attack per round (as swift sword) with a bonus of +1, +2 versus avian and regenerating creatures, +3 versus undead and plant-like creatures. Each arrow fired from the bow is magically ignited with eldritch flame to deal an additional 1d6 fire damage per hit. The arrow flames can be used to ignite readily flammable objects (as the spell kindle flame). This weapon’s damage cannot be further increased with striking or similar effects, and its wielder cannot gain more attacks from swift sword, haste, or similar spells. Value: 170,000gp (+1/2/3 enchantment, 3rd level permanent effect, 2nd level permanent effect, 1st level permanent effect).

**Glaive of the Blade-Goddess:** The bladedancer Aurëlyn Tarcalus wielded this legendary polearm +3 at the Battle of the Fangs, when she held off the orc hordes that threatened to overwhelm the Auran right flank long enough for Malantavius to drive Thrax from the field. Featuring a curved orichalcum blade mounted atop a tall oak pole, the glaive of the blade-goddess can be swung and spun with amazing speed. Its wielder gains a +1 bonus to initiative (canceling the usual -1 penalty for two-handed weapons). If the glaive of the blade-goddess is used to perform a sweeping attack, it deals an extra 1d10 damage on each successful hit (including any subsequent cleaves), and the opponents targeted by the sweeping attack do not receive an opportunity to withdraw. This weapon’s damage cannot be further increased with striking or similar effects. Value: 160,000gp (+3 enchantment, 3rd level permanent effect, two 1st level permanent effects).

**Great Axe of the North:** This long-bearded axe has a rune-carved head and a sturdy yew haft gouged with bite-marks. The hero Sigvhan carried the great axe of the north during his expeditions against Dagr, the frost giant king, north of the Jutting Mountains. The sagas recount that Sigvhan died of wounds received felling Dagr and was interred with the axe by his comrades in a great burial mound on the slopes of Mt. Skarstind.  The great axe of the north is +3, +5 versus dragons and giants, and grants its bearer immunity from cold (as the spell). Once per day, by gnawing on the haft of the axe, a character may enter a greater berserkergang (as the berserker class power). Value: 185,000gp (+3/+4/+5 enchantment, 4th level permanent effect, 3rd level daily effect).

**Javelin of Hurling:** This +2 weapon has a weighted pyramidal head of iron set atop a cedar shaft fastened to a leather throwing strap. When thrown, the javelin of hurling strikes with great force, dealing an additional 1d6 points of damage (as striking) and requiring the creature hit to make a saving throw versus Paralysis. If the creature fails its save, it is knocked back a number of feet equal to the damage dealt by the attack. If this would push the creature into a wall or obstacle, it is knocked down at the point of impact, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10’ it has traveled.  If the creature is pushed into another character or monster, it is knocked down if the character or monster it is pushed into is as large or larger than him. Otherwise, the character/monster is instead knocked down, and the  struck creature continues to be forced back. The javelin of hurling unerringly returns to its thrower’s hand immediately after being thrown. This weapon’s damage cannot be further increased with striking or similar effects. Value: 90,000gp (+3 enchantment, three 1st level permanent effects).

**Red Sword of the Warlord:** Few weapons are so legendary as the red sword of the warlord. The beastman warlord Thrax wielded this orichalcum sword +3 until his death at the Battle of Bythnium and the Tarkaun Audarius XI Ulkyreus later bore it throughout his 42-year reign of conquest and war. Like many other imperial relics, it was lost to history during the Second Imperial Civil War. The wielder of the red sword of the warlord is a veritable god of war on the battlefield. He may make two attacks every round (as per swift sword) and every successful hit deals an extra 1d6 points of damage (as per striking). In addition, the red sword’s wielder may cleave without any limit from his HD, subject only to the availability of enemies within reach given his maximum combat movement per round. The blade of the red sword glimmers scarlet (giving off light like a torch) if brandished  while enemies are within 60’. This weapon’s damage cannot be further increased with striking or similar effects, and its wielder cannot gain more attacks from swift sword, haste, or similar spells. Value: 285,000gp (+3 enchantment, 4th level permanent effect, 3rd level permanent effect, 2nd level permanent effect, 1st level permanent effect).

**Scourge of Law:** This legendary weapon was enchanted in the waning years of Zahar as a tool to detect and destroy practitioners of the heretical Empyrean faith. The scourge of law appears as an enchanted rune-carved metal flail made of segmented hepatizon ( a dark purplish copper). If the scourge is swung overhead, any enemies  within 60’, even if invisible or hidden, are marked by a fiery red aura. The aura is visible only to the wielder and lasts for 6 turns or until the enemy is slain. If the scourge is wrapped around the neck of a helpless lawful creature, the wielder can read the thoughts of the creature (as the spell ESP). If used in battle, the scourge provides its wielder with a +3 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls. However, each time the scourge is used to slay a lawful creature in combat, the scourge’s damage bonus is temporarily increased by +1, up to a maximum damage bonus equal to the wielder’s HD. The damage bonus is lost when the combat ends or one turn (10 minutes) elapses, whichever comes first. Value: 205,000gp (+3 enchantment, 4th level permanent effect, 2nd level permanent effect, 1st level permanent effect).

**Shield of the Empyrean Heavens:** This legendary shield +3 was brought down from Mt. Audarammas by Azendor, prophet of Ammonar, and used by a succession of heroes during the Empyrean War. Like other shields from that archaic era, the shield of the empyrean heavens is approximately 3’ in diameter, with scooped indentations on either side that give it an hourglass-like shape. It is faced with orichalcum and painted with the symbol of the winged sun. Any character bearing the shield is immune to all critical hits. Anytime the bearer raises the shield and concentrates, the shield grants protection from blast (as the spell) to the bearer himself and all creatures within 5’ of him. The protection lasts as long as the bearer concentrates on the effect. Once per day, by clanging his weapon against the shield, the bearer can cast prayer (as the spell). The shield of the empyrean heavens itself cannot be damaged by anything short of a vorpal weapon or disintegration effect. Value 150,000gp (+3 enchantment, 5th level permanent effect, 3rd level daily effect, 2nd level permanent effect).

**Shining Spear:** This legendary spear +3, +4 versus undead, +5 versus demons is crafted of ancient dawn redwood and tipped with a leaf-shaped spearhead of bright orichalcum counterbalanced by an orchicalcum butt-spike. The shining spear grants its wielder immunity to fear while held. Three times per day, by striking the butt-spike on the ground while reciting prayers to the Empyrean gods, the wielder can conjure an angelic aura (as the spell) around himself. Value 150,000gp (+3/4/5 enchantment, 5th level thrice-daily effect, 2nd level permanent effect).

**Sword of Kings:** This legendary sword was wielded by Arëtar Pendaelen when he slew the High King of Jutland on the banks of the River Rorn, and it is said that only a man worthy of Arëtar can tap its powers. In the hands of an ordinary adventurer, it functions as an ordinary sword +3. If brandished by a worthy hero (a chosen, a Nobiran champion, a paladin, or a Lawful fighter with CHA 16 or higher), the sword of kings gains an additional +1 bonus, for a total bonus of +4. Should the hero also rule a domain or realm, it gains another +1 bonus, for a total bonus of +5. The hero-ruler also gains two additional powers drawn from the sword’s ties to the ancient rites of kingship. First, he deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when using the sword to hit Chaotic creatures in his domain or realm. Second, he gains the Nobiran champion’s 13th level class power of oneness of land and lord while within his domain. (If the wielder is a 13th+ level Nobiran champion who already has that class power, then he receives his choice of either the lion-hearted leader or clarion commander class power instead.) This weapon’s damage cannot be increased with striking or similar effects. Value 255,000gp (+5 enchantment, 4th level permanent effect, 2nd level permanent effect).

### Miscellaneous Magic Items

**Chalice of Blood:** By drinking from this silver and bone goblet, a character can gain the strength and knowledge of his slain foes. It is said that the first blood the chalice tasted was that of its own creator, the dark lord Theophanous, who tore out his own heart and drank its hot leakage from the cup to better embrace undeath without the weakness of heart-felt pity or compassion. To use the chalice of blood, a character must first fill its cup with the blood of a sapient lawful victim he has personally slain in the last day. Upon drinking from the chalice, the character immediately gains 2d10+14 temporary hit points + an additional 1 temporary hp per level of the victim. In addition, the character learns some important knowledge possessed by the victim, either a specific set of facts that the character was seeking or some random knowledge chosen by the Judge. The knowledge learned can be quite complex, equivalent to a single rank in a proficiency, a class power, a spell formula, or a language. The character also gains 8 corruption points for each use of the chalice. The temporary hit points will disappear one day later, while the knowledge will fade as if it were a barely-remembered dream. Nothing prevents a character from writing down the knowledge gained before it fades, however. The corruption points are permanent. The chalice can be used once per turn (10 minutes), provided sufficient victims are available. If a character drinks the chalice while already affected by its powers, the additional temporary hp and memories gained by the additional use(s) are cumulative with those already granted, to a maximum of 38 temporary hp. Value 132,000gp (6th level per-turn effect, 2nd level per-turn effect).

**Chariot of the Gods:** A chariot of the gods appears as a magnificent  wheeled vehicle constructed from slates of dawn redwood and reinforced with bronze. Chariots of the gods come in three sizes, with their crew, combat characteristics and dimensions determined by their size:  

*Light Chariot of the Gods:* This chariot has two wheels on an axle set at the very rear of the body for maximum mobility and stability. The chariot’s wheels are about 2’6” in diameter. Its wheel track is about 5’9” wide, while its total length, including harnessed creatures, is 11’6”. The cab measures 3’3” wide, 1’8” deep, and 2’6” high, with room for two man-sized creatures, one of whom must be the driver. The cab includes three built in weapon-cases, with room for a composite bow, 3 javelins, and 20 arrows. A light chariot of the gods has AC 0 and 5 shp. It may be pulled by one or two creatures whose normal loads add up to at least 40 stone. The chariot can transport up to the harnessed creatures’ combined normal load at 3/4 the harnessed creatures’ movement rate, or up to the harnessed creature’s combined maximum load at 3/8 the harnessed creatures’ movement rate.

*Medium Chariot of the Gods:* This chariot has two wheels on an axle set beneath the center of the cab. The chariot’s wheels are about 3’ in diameter. Its wheel track is about 6’6” wide, while its total length is 13’. The cab measures 4’ wide, 3’ deep, and 3’ high, with room for three man-sized creatures, one of whom must be the driver. The cab includes three built in weapon-cases, with room for a composite bow, 3 javelins, and 20 arrows. The sturdily-built cab provides its occupants with a +1 AC bonus against attacks to the front and flank. A medium chariot of the gods has AC 1 and 8 shp. It may be pulled by two or three creatures whose normal loads add up to at least 60 stone. The chariot can transport up to the harnessed creatures’ combined normal load at 2/3 the harnessed creatures’ movement rate, or up to the harnessed creature’s combined maximum load at 1/3 the harnessed creatures’ movement rate. The chariot may not exceed 240’ per turn in any case.  

*Heavy chariot:* This chariot has two or four wheels on an axle set beneath the center of the cab. The chariot’s wheels are about 5’ in diameter. Its wheel track is about 7’ wide, while its total length is 15’. The cab measures 4’6” wide, 3’3” deep, and 3’9” high, with room for four man-sized creatures, one of whom must be the driver. The cab includes three built in weapon-cases, with room for a composite bow, 3 javelins, and 20 arrows. The armored cab provides its occupants with a +2 AC bonus against attacks to the front and flank. A heavy chariot of the gods has AC 2 and 10 shp. It may be pulled by two, three, or four flying creatures whose normal loads add up to at least 80 stone. The chariot can transport up to the harnessed creatures’ combined normal load at 1/2 the harnessed creatures’ movement rate, or up to the harnessed creature’s combined maximum load at 1/4 the harnessed creatures’ movement rate. The chariot may not exceed 180’ per turn in any case.

Crew	Combat Characteristics	Dimensions

|Chariot Type|	Driver|	Warriors|	Animals|	Move|	Max Move|	AC|	AC Bonus|	SHP|	Chariot	Cab  / Platform
|:
|Light|	1|	1|	1 - 2|	x3/4|	360’|	0|	0|	5|	5’9” x 11’6”	3’3” x 1’8” x 2’6”

Unlike ordinary chariots, chariots of the gods can traverse empty space (thin air) as if it were solid, level ground. When a chariot of the gods is hitched to flying creatures capable of pulling it, it can soar through the heavens as easily as an ordinary chariot rolls traverses the battlefield or race-course. Anytime a chariot of the gods is in the air, it glows brilliantly (as the spell continual illumination) and the chariot, its driver, and its passengers enjoy protection from normal missiles as well as resistance to cold, fire, and lighting. Value: 1,175,000gp heavy, 950,000gp medium, 725,000gp light (3rd level permanent effect, 3-5 additional 3rd level permanent effects, 3-5 2nd level permanent effects, and 7-13 additional 2nd level permanent effects, for chariot and passengers).

**Collar of Conversation:** When this bejeweled leather collar is fastened around the throat of an animal, it grants the animal wearing it the ability to comprehend and converse in the language of any intelligent creature within 60’ of the animal. For purposes of speech, an animal wearing the collar of conversation has an effective INT ability score equal to 6 +/- Trainability Modifier. For instance, a white ape (TM +3) wearing the collar has an effective INT 9, while a crocodile (TM -1) wearing it has an effective INT 5.  If the collar is fastened around the throat of a sapient creature, it has no magical effect, but may inspire interesting conversations all the same. Value 100,000gp (3rd level permanent effect, 1st level permanent effect).

**Cloak of Skinchanging:** By raising the hood and wrapping himself in the folds of the cloak of skin-changing, the wearer can change into the form of a specific animal (determined by the type of cloak). While transformed, the wearer gains all of the physical characteristics, movement types, attack routines, and special abilities of his new form while retaining his own mental abilities. Once transformed, the wearer can remain in animal form indefinitely, but may return to his own form at any time. If slain while transformed, the wearer reverts to his original form. Once the wearer returns to his own form, the cloak’s powers may not be used again for one hour (six turns). Cloaks of skinchanging traditionally come in one of four types, shown below. The Judge can choose or roll randomly for the type of cloak found, or make cloaks for other types of animals appropriate to his setting. Value 24,000gp (3rd level hourly effect).

|Roll (d4)|	Animal|	Characteristics
|:-:|:-:|:---
|1|	Bear|	Move 120’, AC 3, #AT 2 claws, 1 bite, Dmg 1d3/1d3/1d6, bear hug
|2|	Hawk|	Move 480’ fly, AC 1, #AT 2 talons, Dmg 1d2/1d2, swoop attack
|3|	Swan|	Move 360’ fly, AC 3, #AT 2 wings, 1 bill, Dmg 1/1/1d2
|4|	Wolf|	Move 180’, AC 2, #AT 1 bite, Dmg 1d6

**Dead Mans’ Hand:** This grotesque artifact of necromantic blasphemy is composed of the dried and pickled hand of a lawfully-executed murderer, upon which is mounted a candle formed from the fat of the same murderer. For any of the powers of the dead man’s hand to be used, its candle must be lit. The flame from the hand’s candle gives off no radiance and never seems to burn down, but like any flame can be extinguished by strong wind or water.

While the hand’s candle is lit, the hand grants its bearer infravision (as the spell) as well as two spell-like abilities each useable once per turn. First, by speaking the dead murder’s true name, the bearer of the hand can cast hold person (as the spell). Second, by speaking the name of the murderer’s last victim, the bearer can cast knock (as the spell). A dead man’s hand can be used by any character, but is most sought after by thieves, freebooters, and assassins. Value: 86,000gp (4th level daily effect, 3rd level per-turn effect, 2nd level per-turn effect).

**Emblem of the Eagle:** This legendary insignia was first carried by the legion of Audarius Tarkaun when he defeated Baal the Terrible at the gates of Zidium, and for centuries afterward served as the insignia of the Auran Army. During the tumult of the Second Imperial Civil War, the emblem was smuggled out of the capital by the Emperor’s Talons, but no record of its final whereabouts exists.

The emblem of the eagles consists of a gold eagle mounted atop a 12’ tall pole. To use the emblem, a character must affix the flag of an organized military unit, division, or army to the emblem’s pole and bear it into battle. Bearing the emblem counts as wielding a weapon or shield (e.g. the emblem’s bearer can bear the emblem in one hand and either wield a one-handed weapon or a shield in his other hand).

In combat, the emblem of the eagle inspires the troops who serve under it with invincible courage.  Friendly creatures within 30’ of the emblem are protected from harm by normal weapons. Magic or silver weapons can harm the protected creatures, but any number of normal swords, arrows, clubs, or natural weapons will be fended off. Monsters which themselves can only be affected by silver or magical weapons can still harm the protected creatures, however, as can monsters with 5 HD or more through natural ferocity. The protection afforded by the emblem is lost for the duration of the fight if at any time the bearer is slain, flees, or drops the emblem (voluntarily or involuntarily).

If the emblem is carried as the flag of a company-sized unit on the battlefield, the entire unit is protected from harm by normal weapons. The unit cannot be damaged by missile or melee attacks from units of less than 5 HD without silver or magical weapons, and is never considered threatened by enemy units that are unable to damage it.  The effect ends if the unit ever recoils, flees, or routs.

If the emblem is carried as the flag of an army leader’s unit, then so long as the unit carrying the emblem is fighting on the battlefield with its army, the entire army automatically stands firm on its first morale, or rallies if it would have stood firm. However, this benefit is lost for the duration of the battle if the unit carrying the emblem is destroyed, routed, or leaves the battle. Value: 808,500gp (six 8th level permanent effects, 1st level per-turn effect).

**Helm of Awe:** This orichalcum helmet has an open face with long cheek guards and a tall red crest. The wearer of the helm of awe inspires dread in the hearts of his enemies. The first time each day that each enemy creature  approaches within 15’ of the wearer, that creature must make a saving throw versus Spells. Any creatures that fail the save are frightened for 30 rounds. A frightened creature will run from the source of its fear at its full movement rate. If a frightened creature cannot flee, its cower in terror. An engaged creature that is frightened will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends. Creatures that successfully save are not affected. Whether they make or fail their saving throw, creatures encountering the wearer of the helm of awe cannot be affected by its magic again until the following day. Value: 67,500gp (3rd level permanent once-per-creature effect).

**Holy Talisman of the Winged Sun:** This legendary relic was said to have been carried down from Mt. Audarammas by Azendor, prophet of Ammonar, when the Laws of Light first returned to mankind. It was lost to history when Baal the Terrible sacked Aura, and remains much sought by the Temple of the Winged Sun. Any character of Lawful alignment who bears the holy talisman gains the protection of strength of mind (a bonus of +4 to saving throws versus Death, Staffs, Wands, Paralysis, Petrification, and Spells). If the bearer is also a divine or eldritch caster or ceremonialist, he can also use the holy talisman to cast holy word, restore life and limb, and harvest once per week each, and to cast dispel evil once per turn. Value: 213,000gp (three 7th level weekly effects, 5th level permanent effect, 5th level daily effect).

**Iron-bound Book of Xisuthros:** Written by the chthonic priest Xisuthros a thousand years before the Auran Empire dawned, the iron-bound book contains innumerable incantations and workings of black magic and demonology. It is said that writing the iron-bound book drove Xisuthros mad, and that the book’s final pages were cut from his own flesh and inked with his own blood. Whether Xisuthros was mad or simply esoteric, the iron-bound book is so cryptic that understanding its secrets often requires numerous re-readings.

Any character literate in Ancient Zaharan can read the iron-bound book. Reading the entire book requires one day (8 hours) of game time, but need not take place in one sitting. Each time a character reads the entire book, he should roll 1d100 to determine whether he has learned some valuable piece of lore. The chance of learning lore starts at 6% and increases with each additional re-read of the entire book, as shown on the Iron-Bound Book table, adjacent. If a character successfully learns from the book the Judge should roll 1d20 on the Black Lore table below to determine what the character learns – a spell formula, a potion formula, a ritual formula, or the true name of a cacodemon. (Ceremonialists who read the book should learn ceremonial formulas instead of spell formulas.)

**Note:** Possessing a cacodemon’s true name allows a character to conjure that specific cacodemon in lieu of rolling for a random one (as described in the various conjure cacodemon spells). Possessing a potion formula or ritual formula allows a character to pursue magic research into that potion or ritual at half the base time and cost. Possessing a spell formulas allows the character to add that spell to the caster’s repertoire if the character can still learn new spells of that level. If the character’s repertoire is full, or if the spell is of too high level for him to learn, then the spell cannot be put into the repertoire, but the formula may be saved to be put into the repertoire in the future. It takes one week of study to add a spell to the character’s repertoire from the formula.

Though it may reveal long-lost secrets, the iron-bound book eventually brings ruin on those who read it. Each time a  character reads the book, he gains 1d10 points of corruption and risks slipping into madness. The percentage chance of slipping into madness starts at 1% and increases with each additional reading, as shown on the Iron-Bound Book table, above. A characters who slips into madness fall under the Judge’s control for a number of weeks equal to the number of times he has read the entire book. The madness caused by the book cannot be cured by any means save wish or miracle. Value: 125,000gp (5th level permanent effect)

**Iron Crown of the Sorcerer-Kings:** This legendary regalia was created by Uragasi, first sorcerer-king of Zahar, conqueror of the Thrassians. It was worn by every reigning sorcerer-king thereafter until it was lost to history during the fall of Zahar. While the iron crown is worn, the wearer regenerates 3 hit points each round. If the wearer is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, he immediately rolls 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table, applying the usual modifier for Hit Points and Constitution, but applying a +11 bonus in lieu of the usual modifiers for Treatment and Timing. After the mortal wound (if any) is determined, the wearer is then immediately restored to 1 hp without any need for best rest. Any limbs or body parts lost to mortal wounds will attempt to crawl or squirm back to the main portion of the body to reattach, and can be reattached instantly simply by being held to the stump. If severed limbs or parts are forcibly kept from reattaching, the lost limbs and parts, along with any/all other mortal wounds received, will be restored when the wearer regenerates to full hit points. The wearer of the iron crown can only be actually killed if he is disintegrated, slain by death magic, or slain while helpless by an unengaged combatant.

Each day that the iron crown of the sorcerer-kings is worn, its wearer accumulates 6 corruption points due to its necromantic influence. The crown will never accidentally slip from a Chaotic wearer’s brow, but it can be voluntarily removed, and it can be knocked from its wearer’s brow with a successful Disarm special maneuver. Value: 300,000gp (two 6th level permanent effects).

**Panoply of the Imperial Warmistress:** This legendary set of items was created for Zeodarë I, the first woman acclaimed Tarkaun, by the Temple of the Winged Sun in gratitude for her re-building the Golden Temple on Mt. Audarammas. The panoply was lost centuries later during the widespread looting of the Second Imperial Civil War, and its whereabouts remain unknown. The panoply consists of a pair of bracers, a pair of boots, a corselet, and a diadem, described below.

*Bracers of the Imperial Warmistress:* The wearer of these shining orichalcum bracers is immune to normal missile attacks (as the spell protection from normal missiles) and gains a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws (as the spell eldritch protection). Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. Value: 166,250gp (two 3rd level permanent effects, fractional set powers)

*Boots of the Imperial Warmistress:* A character wearing these strappy red leather boots has an effective Dexterity 18 for all purposes, with a +3 bonus to armor class, initiative, DEX-based attack throws, and relevant proficiency throws. She may spring up to 10’ high and to a distance of 30’, gains a +10 bonus on Acrobatics throws, and need not rest if engaged in ordinary movement. Both boots must be worn for the magic to be effective. Value: 116,250gp (2nd level permanent effect, two 1st level permanent effects, fractional set powers)

*Corselet of the Imperial Warmistress:* This body-hugging corselet is crafted of red leather and ornamented with a gleaming orichalcum eagle. It grants its wearer resistance to cold (as the spell) and an Armor Class of 7 against attacks of all sorts (as the spell eldritch armor). The corselet does not stack with worn normal or magical armor, if any, but other enhancements to AC (including that from the bracers of the imperial warmistress) will function normally.  Value: 116,250gp (two 2nd level permanent effects, fractional set powers)

*Diadem of the Imperial Warmistress:* This ornamental headband is forged of bright orichalcum and set with a ruby sun. While wearing the diadem, the character has an effective Charisma 18 for all purposes, with a +3 bonus to reaction rolls, loyalty, and number of henchmen. In addition, she is immune to fear. Value: 116,250gp (two 2nd level permanent effects, fractional set powers)

A bladedancer or warmistress equipped with at least two of the four components of the panoply gains the ability to cast swift sword once per day. If equipped with at least three of the four components, she gains the ability to cast striking once per day. If equipped with the entire panoply, she gains the ability to cast winged flight once per day. (The set power cost was calculated by dividing the base cost of each of the three daily effects by the corresponding number of items in the set required to access that power, then applying that cost to all items in the set.)

### Potions, Philters, & Oils

Drinking a potion causes the listed spell effect to target the imbiber for a duration of 1d6+6 turns, or the duration of the spell granted by the potion, whichever is shorter. There are three exceptions to this rule.

*	Potions enchanted with spells of indefinite duration remain indefinite and the potion’s effects are permanent until dispelled. Such potions are normally known as philters (e.g. philter of love).
*	Potions enchanted with spells of instantaneous duration (such as various types of healing potions) remain instantaneous. However, as with all potions, the target is the character who drinks the potion - a potion cannot imbue a character with the ability to cast an instantaneous spell on another creature or area. A potion of cure light wounds healers the imbiber as if the spell had been cast on him; it doesn’t let the imbiber cast cure light wounds. A hypothetical potion of fireball would causes the imbiber to suffer the effects of a fireball, not grant the ability to cast one.  
*	Potions enchanted with spells that affect objects must be poured or rubbed on the object. Such potions are normally known as oils (e.g. oil of sharpness).

Drinking a potion or pouring an oil takes one round. Drinking an oil takes one round, too, but has no effect. The effects begin in the same round as their consumption. If a character drinks a potion while another potion (other than a philter) is in effect, the character will be sickened and unable to take any actions for 3 turns (30 minutes); neither potion will have any other affect.

The spell triggered by a potion has a caster level equal to the minimum caster level required to cast the spell.

**Waybread:** Although it resembles an ordinary loaf of bread, waybread is actually made of ancient strands of grain carefully cultivated over generations by the elves. It is both delicious and nutritious; indeed, a single slice of waybread is enough for a man-sized creature to survive for a day without any other food or water. When found, a typical loaf of waybread will have 2d6 slices remaining. As long as waybread is stored in its original wrappings of dried leaves, it remains fresh indefinitely. Value: 4,500gp per loaf (5th level single-use effect, 4th level single-use effect).

### Rings

All magical rings are usable by any character class. They must be worn on a digit of the hands only (fingers or thumb). It is only possible to wear two magical rings; if more than two are worn all of the rings do not function.

**Ring of Anti-Magic:** The wearer of this ring is protected by a 10’ radius shell of anti-magic that stops any spell or spell-like effects (including the wearer’s) from coming in or going out. Spell-like effects are all effects that duplicate a spell, or magical effects that are resisted with a saving throw versus Spells or Staffs & Wands (but excluding effects that do not duplicate a spell and are resisted with saving throws versus Poison, Breath, Paralysis, or Petrification). Spells with a range of “self,” or “touch” spells used on the wearer himself, are not blocked by the ring of anti-magic. If a creature or item with an ongoing spell or spell-like effect enters the ring’s shell, the spell or effect is dispelled as if by a dispel magic; effects which cannot be dispelled (such as magic weapon bonuses) are not affected. The anti-magic shell created by the ring cannot itself be dispelled. Value: 150,000gp (6th level permanent effect).

**Ring of the Queen’s Heart:** According to legend, this bejeweled band was used by the sorceress-queen Semiramis during her courtship by the hundred lords of her realm. The wearer of the ring of the queen’s heart becomes completely immune to enchantments, including charm, hold, sleep, Mystic Aura, and other related effects. Once per turn, by kissing the ring of the queen’s heart, the wearer can become invisible (as the spell). Value: 191,000gp (5th level permanent effect, 4th level per-turn effect).

**Seal of Chaos:** This item resembles a signet ring forged of adamant and hepatizon bearing the seal of the chthonic powers. It grants the wearer the ability to conjure spirits from the chthonic and elemental spheres. The wearer can use each of the following spells once per day: conjure cacodemon spawn, conjure imp, conjure hellion, conjure dybbuk, conjure fiend, conjure elemental, and conjure genie.  In addition, the wearer of the seal of chaos can speak with animals at will. The wearer of the seal gains corruption points equal to the level of the spell each time its conjuration effects are used. Value: 185,000gp (two 6th level daily effects, two 5th level daily effects, 4th level daily effect, 3rd level daily effect, 2nd level daily effect, 1st level daily effect, 2nd level permanent effect).

### Rods, Staffs, and Wands

Wands are only usable by arcane or eldritch classes. Rods may be usable by arcane, divine, and/or eldritch classes, or any class at all, depending on the kind of rod. Staffs may be usable by arcane, divine, and/or eldritch classes, depending on the kind of staff. When a class-restricted item is described, the name of the item will be followed by either “D” if it is usable by a divine class, “A” if it is usable by arcane classes, and “E” if it is usable by eldritch classes.

Each of these magic items generally uses a charge when its effect is triggered, and each item has a limited number of charges. When found, a rod will contain 2d6 charges, a staff will contain 3d10 charges, and a wand will contain 2d10 charges. Exceptions will be noted in specific item descriptions. Physically, these three types of magic items differ primarily in size. Wands are small and thin, being about 18” long. A staff is much larger, being 6’ long and generally has a 2” diameter. Rods are somewhere in-between these two kinds of items, being about 3’ long. Wands cast spells at minimum caster level while rods and staffs cast spells at minimum caster level +3.

**Rod of the Night Sky [ADE]:** This legendary device grants its bearer the power of the stars themselves.  Just as the stars move across the heavens, the powers of the rod of the night sky change with every month of the year; but each month always provides three powers that can each be used once per day In order for the rod to function, its dials and switches must be rotated to correctly match the configuration of the constellation currently within the zodiac, which requires a successful Knowledge (astrology) proficiency throw. Once properly configured, the rod of the night sky can be used by  any arcane, divine, and eldritch casters and ceremonialists. If the rod is used to cast black magic spells, the wielder gains corruption points equal to the level of the spell cast each time.  
 
The table below lists the constellations of the zodiac for the Auran Empire setting, along with the powers afforded to the bearer when so configured. The Judge may substitute zodiac signs of his own design in lieu of those listed below; each zodiac sign should have three powers, totaling 12 total levels of spells (e.g. 1 6th, 1 4th, and 1 2nd level power, or 1 6th, 1 5th, and 1 st, or 2 5th and 1 2nd, etc.) All of the spells are cast at minimum caster level. Value: 360,000gp (12 spell levels available for daily use one month out of each year, at a cost of x5, for 12 x 500 x 5 = 30,000gp per set of monthly powers, x 12 months).

|Zodiac	|Powers

**Rod of Torture [ADE]:** This black iron rod is topped with a blood-stained bulbous tip and capped with a forked spike. In the hands of an arcane, divine, or eldritch caster or ceremonialist who knows its command words, the rod of torture can be used to cast each of the following spells once per day: circle of agony, iron maiden, dismember, bloody flux, slicing blow. All of the spells are cast at minimum caster level +3. The wielder gains  corruption points equal to the level of the spell cast each time a charge is expended. Value: 60,000gp (5th level charged effect, plus one-half cost of 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st level charged effects, at 12 charges).

**Staff of Cataclysm [ADE]:** Imperial history exists in the aftermath of a mysterious and apocalyptic event known as the Day Without Night. Whether the staff of cataclysm brought about the Day Without Night, or was made merely in imitation of it,  it is a potent and terrible weapon of wizardry. The staff of cataclysm can be used to cast each of the following spells at a cost of one charge each: ice storm, inferno, starfall, sunder structure, thunderbolt. The staff can also be used to cast the ritual cataclysm in one round at a cost of two charges. Once cast, the actual cataclysm comes into effect seven weeks later. In the interim, ominous signs and portents will warn of imminent doom, with increasing frequency as the cataclysm nears. The cataclysm can only be stopped with a wish or miracle or by destroying the staff. Destroying the staff causes an explosion that deals 8 points of damage per charge remaining in the staff to all creatures within 30’. The staff of cataclysm can be used by  any arcane, divine, and eldritch casters and ceremonialists. All of the spells are cast at 14th level. Value: 292,500gp (9th level charged effect at 15 charges, plus one-half cost of five 6th level charged effects at 30 charges).

**Staff of Elemental Power [AE]:** These mighty staffs were created by elven wizards of Argollë at the noontide of that kingdom’s glory. Each of the four staffs of elemental power is the embodiment of its sphere’s magical force. Each staff can be used by arcane or eldritch classes to cast any of its spells at a cost of one charge each. The four types and their powers are noted below. Roll randomly to determine the type of staff found. All of the spells are cast at minimum caster level +3 (14th and 12th for 6th and 5th respectively). Value: 210,000gp (6th level charged effect, plus one-half cost of 6th level and two 5th level charged effects, at 30 charges).

*Staff of Elemental Air:* control weather, thunderbolt, control winds, summon weather

*Staff of Elemental Earth:* move earth, sunder structure, tremor, weave stone

*Staff of Elemental Fire:* inferno, starfall, pillar of fire, phoenix aura

*Staff of Elemental Water:* capsizing wave, lower water, cone of frost, ice sheet

**Wand of Frost [AE]:** This wand projects a cone of freezing water 60’ long and 30’ wide stretching from its tip, as the spell cone of frost. The cone deals 6d4 points of damage to all creatures within its area of effect, or half that with a successful saving throw versus Blast. One charge is expended per usage. It can be used by any arcane or eldritch caster or ceremonialist. The spell is cast at 9th level. Value: 50,000gp (5th level charged effect at 20 charges).

**Wand of Impetus [AE]:** This wand can fling one or more objects or creatures within range a distance of up to 20’, as the spell force of impetus. The wielder can target up to nine creatures or objects of 18 stone (180lb) or less, or a single creature or object weighing up to 162 stone (1,620lb). One charge is expended per usage. It can be used by any arcane or eldritch caster or ceremonialist. The spell is cast at 9th level. Value: 50,000gp (5th level charged effect at 20 charges).

It can be used by any arcane or eldritch caster or ceremonialist. The spell is cast at 9th caster level. Value: 50,000gp (5th level charged effect at 20 charges).

### Scrolls

A scroll of spells will be found with anywhere from 1 to 42 spell levels written on it. In heroic fantasy campaigns, spell scrolls will contain spells from the eldritch spell list. Eldritch scrolls are divided into white, grey, and black scrolls, which represent the predominant type of magic that will be found on the scroll. When determining the contents of a scroll of spells, first to determine the color of scroll (white, grey, or black) on the Scroll Color table. Then roll on the Language by Scroll Color table to determine what language the scroll is written in. Next, roll as many times as needed to generate individual spells on the Spell Level by Total Spell Levels Remaining on Scroll Table. Next, determine the color of each spell on the scroll on the Spell Color by Scroll Type table. Then choose or roll for each spell on the appropriate eldritch list.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is placing a rare scroll of 20 spell levels. He first rolls 1d6 to determine the scroll’s color, scoring a 5 – so the scroll is grey. Next, he rolls on the Language by Scroll Color table, scoring a 34. On the Grey column, that results in a scroll written in Draconic. Now he must determine the individual spells on the scroll. Since there are 9+ spell levels on the scroll, he rolls on that column initially. A result of 26 indicates a 2nd level spell, and 18 spell levels remaining. On the same column, a result of 87 indicates a 5th level spell, and 13 spell levels remaining. On the same column, a result of 84 indicates a 4th level spell, and 9 spell levels remaining. On the same column, a result of 40 indicates a 2nd level spell, and 7 spell level remaining. He now switches to the 7 column and rolls 1d100. A roll of 88 indicates a 5th level spell, and 2 spell levels remaining. He now switches to the 2 column and rolls 1d100. A result of 55 indicates a 2nd level spell, and no spells level remaining. The scroll contains two 5th, one 4th, and three 2nd level spells. The Judge now determines the color each of these spells on the Spell Color by Scroll Color table. He rolls 1d6 for each spell and cross-indexes the row of the result with the Grey column. The result is 5th, roll 1, white; 5th, roll 4, grey; 4th, roll 5, grey; 2nd, roll 6, black; 2nd, roll 1, white; and 2nd, roll 3, grey. The result is a scroll written in draconic with one 5th level white spell, one 5th level grey spell, one 4th level grey spell, one 2nd level white spell, one 2nd level grey spell, and one 2nd level black spell. The Judge decides to theme the scroll around illusion, and selects true seeing, mirage, spectral force, noiselessness, phantasmal force, and undetectable charm.

#### Reagents

In some campaigns, spell scrolls may be replaced with reagents. A reagent is a special component that has had its latent energies configured for use in casting a particular spell. Reagents might include mummy wrappings of fear, troll blood of regeneration, or bronze golem slag of giant strength. Reagents are typically found in bundles of 1 to 7.

Reagents radiate as magical under detection. Adventurers with Alchemy, Collegiate Wizardry, Magical Engineering, or Naturalism proficiency can identify the properties of a found reagent. A proficiency throw of 14+ is required; the target value is reduced by 4 for each additional proficiency rank the character possesses in any of the appropriate proficiencies, to a minimum of 2+. A Loremastery throw can be used in lieu of these proficiencies at the character’s unmodified target value. If the throw fails, the adventurer is ignorant of the properties of the reagent. If the throw succeeds, the adventurer learns the spell contained in the reagent.

Characters can only cast a spell using a reagent if the spell is on their class list, but the spell does not need to be in their repertoire. A spell may be cast using a reagent even if it is not normally usable by a spellcaster of the user’s level. Reagent spells are cast as if from a spell caster of the minimum level required to cast the spell. Once a spell is cast using a reagent, the magical energies in the reagent are expended.

If a character discovers a reagent for a spell that is not in his repertoire, he may expend the reagent to add it to his repertoire if the character can still learn new spells of that level. If the spell is of too high level to be cast, it cannot be put into the repertoire, but the reagent may be saved to be put into the repertoire in the future. It takes one week of experimentation with the reagent to add its spell to the character’s repertoire. The reagent is used up in the process.

Casters may create reagents at the same level they would otherwise be able to scribe scrolls. Creating a reagent has a base cost of 500gp per spell level and a time requirement of 1 week per spell level. Special components with a value equal to the base cost are also required. (Technically speaking, these special components are transformed into the reagent, rather than being consumed in its creation.) If these optional rules are used, all other references to scrolls, including in proficiencies and class powers, should be replaced by reference to reagents.

**Note:** The scroll is an anomaly within d20 fantasy role-playing games. While almost every other magic item in the genre can be traced to a mythological or literary precedent, the scroll seems to be purely mechanical invention for the game. In the bibliography of the Heroic Fantasy Handbook, we uncovered not even one recorded instance of a magical scroll that can be used once and then crumbles away. What we did uncover were powders, candles, herbs, and other components filling a similar role.

### Trinkets and Talismans

#### Trinkets

A ceremonial trinket is a minor magic item that allows a ceremonialist to perform the ceremony it contains as if he were casting it as a spell. A ceremonial trinket has three characteristics: the object itself, the tradition it was made with, and the ceremony it contains. Entries on the Magic Items table may result in a set of 1 to 16 rechargeable trinkets being placed in a treasure hoard. Each set of trinkets will always belong to the same tradition, but will carry a mix of eldritch spells.

When placing a set of trinkets in a treasure hoard, first determine their tradition by rolling 1d8 on the Trinkets & Talisman Tradition table. Then, for each trinket in the set, determine the color of spell contained in each trinket by rolling 1d10 on the Trinket Spell Color by Tradition. Next, choose or roll for each spell on the appropriate eldritch list. Finally, roll 1d100 on the Trinket & Talisman Object by Tradition table to determine the nature of the trinket.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is placing a set of five 3rd level rechargeable trinkets. He rolls 1d8 to determine the trinkets’ tradition, and scores a 3 – so this set of trinkets is liturgical. He now rolls 1d10 for each of the five trinkets to determine what color of eldritch magic each holds. His results are 3, 3, 4, 5, 9, so there are four white and one grey trinkets. He selects cure blindness, cure disease, cure moderate wounds, and remove curse from the 3rd level white magic list, and hypnotic pattern from the grey magic list. <br>
The Judge then rolls 1d100 five times on the Trinket & Talisman Object table, cross-referencing each row result with the Liturgical column, to determine the nature of each of the five trinkets. His results are 84, 15, 68, 8, and 47, so the set of trinkets consists of a skull of cure blindness, a book of cure disease, a phylactery of cure moderate wounds, an altar cloth of remove curse, and a gem of hypnotic pattern.

#### Talismans

A ceremonial talisman is a magic item that provides a bonus to ceremony throws made to perform particular types of ceremonies. A ceremonial talisman is described with four characteristics: its object, its tradition, its bonus, and its type. Talisman bonuses can range from +1 to +4. Talisman types include: death & necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment & illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification. A talisman can aid just one type of ceremonies, or several types.

Entries on the Magic Items table may result in talismans with a total bonus (across all types of spells) of up to +16. When placing a talisman in a treasure hoard, first determine the talisman’s tradition by rolling 1d8 on the Trinkets & Talisman Tradition table. Then, for each bonus afforded by the talisman, roll 1d100 on the Talisman Bonus Type by Tradition table until each bonus has been allocated to a particular type. If the same type is rolled more than once, the bonus stacks, to a maximum bonus of +4. Re-roll results that yield bonuses of greater than +4 for any particular type of spell. Finally, roll 1d100 on the Trinket & Talisman Object by Tradition table to determine the nature of the talisman.

EXAMPLE: The Judge is placing a rare trinket +5. He first rolls 1d8 to determine the trinket’s tradition, rolling a 2 – so the talisman is chthonic. Now, he rolls 1d100 five times (one for each +1) on the Talisman Type by Tradition table, cross-referencing each row result with the chthonic He rolls 90, 87, 70, 21, and 9, for a result of  Summoning, Summoning, Healing Detection, and Death & Necromancy. The Judge now rolls 1d100 on the Trinket & Talisman Object by Tradition table, and cross-references the result row of 99 with the Chthonic column, indicating an unholy symbol. The talisman is therefore an unholy symbol of +2 summoning, +1 death & necromancy, detection, and healing.
