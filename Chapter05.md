# Chapter 5: Heroic Magic

*“The sorcerer was named Erreth-Akbe, and he was both king and wizard in the West. He came to our lands and fought for the rule of the city with the High Priest of the Inmost Temple of the Twin Gods. Long they fought, the man's sorcery against the lightning of the gods, and the temple was destroyed around them. At last the High Priest broke the sorcerer's witching-staff, broke in half his  amulet of power, and defeated him. He escaped from the city and from the Kargish lands, and fled clear across Earthsea to the farthest west; and there a dragon slew him, because his power was gone.”* – Thar, in The Tomb of Atuan (Ursula K. LeGuin)

## Illusions

Those who see an illusion believe it to be real unless they succeed on a saving throw versus Spells. If the illusion would, in reality, be accompanied by senses (sounds, smells, textures, or temperatures) that the spell does not provide, the victims of the illusion will gain a +4 bonus to their saving throw per missing sense.

EXAMPLE: A fighter is struck by an illusion of a fireball conjured by phantasmal force. Because phantasmal force does not create the sounds, smells, textures, or temperatures of an actual fireball, the fighter gains a +16 bonus on his saving throw.


## Eldritch Magic

Magic in heroic fantasy is more subtle than the spectacular effects which are commonplace in traditional ACKS games. Spells tend to work with the existing environment, rather than conjure effects from thin air. Enchantments and illusion are commonplace, while elemental blasts are less so. This subtle, but powerful magic, is called eldritch magic, and it constitutes a new type of magic that has facets of both arcane and divine magic.

The spells on the three Eldritch Spells lists (on p. XX) represent the common spells known to the practitioners of the eldritch arts. These are by no means meant to be complete lists, for eldritch spellcasters are a secretive lot that do not share their knowledge easily; and many spells that were once known have been forgotten, existing only in dusty tomes and rare grimoires, or in the minds of slumbering undead lords.

Any spells on the Eldritch Spells list can be learned when advancing in level. Spells not on the Eldritch Spells lists cannot be learned when advancing in level, only by studying with teacher, reading a book or scroll, or researching the spell in the campaign world.

**Note:** Some spells which could be built with eldritch magic under the rules in the Player’s Companion have been purposefully left off the Eldritch Spells lists because we felt they did not fit with the flavor of heroic fantasy. The Judge has the ultimate say over whether a particular eldritch spell exists in his heroic fantasy setting.

### Eldritch Magic Research

Starting at 5th level, eldritch spellcasters may begin to independently research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. When eldritch spellcasters reach 9th level, they may create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, eldritch spellcasters may learn and cast 7th, 8th, and 9th level ritual spells, crossbreed monsters, and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, eldritch spellcaster may create necromantic servants and even become undead themselves. In addition, all eldritch spellcasters are capable of drawing on divine power through congregations or blood sacrifice, like clerics. Eldritch ceremonialists who perform blood sacrifices gain points of corruption equal to the HD of the target sacrificed.

### Eldritch and Arcane

Except where noted in this chapter, assume that any rules that apply to arcane magic apply to eldritch magic. For example, eldritch casters follow the same rules for casting spells, spell repertoire, reversible spells, and spell signatures, that arcane casters follow.

## The Shades of Magic

*He held parley with the Dwellers in pits beyond geometric space, he gave homage to hideous demons seen by the aid of Avernian drugs that blasted the user. From sea-corroded Atlantean columns, he gleaned a lore that seared his very soul in the gleaning; on lost papyri of prehistoric Egypt, and tablets of green brass from Eighur tombs, he found the wisdom that was henceforth as a mordant charnel-worm in his brain. And great, by virtue of all this, was the reward that he won and the masterdom he achieved.* – The Infernal Star (C.A. Smith)

Because it weaves together threads of both arcane and divine magic without the protection of an intermediary power, eldritch magic can be dangerous to a caster’s soul. Eldritch casters divide their spells into three categories, depending on how dangerous they are to case. Spells which have an inherently corrupting influence on the soul are black magic. Spells which may or may not be corrupting, depending on the purposes to which they are used, are grey magic. Spells which are inherently safe to cast are called white magic.

### Corruption

Eldritch spellcasters acquire corruption points whenever they learn or cast a black magic spell, or cast grey magic spells for certain corrupt purposes:

*	Each time a black magic spell is learned, the caster acquires a number of corruption points equal to the spell’s level.
*	Each time a black magic spell is cast, the caster acquires one additional corruption point.  
*	Each time a grey magic spell is used in order to coerce, deceive, harm, or rob a Lawful or sapient Neutral target, the caster acquires one corruption point.

Characters can also gain corruption points by spending time in a sinkhole of evil (see p. XX), by making blood sacrifices (see p. XX), and by using evil magic items (p. XX). For purposes of corruption, ceremonialists are casters, and ceremonies are spells (see p. XX).

EXAMPLE: Baldur, a Nobiran wizard, has come into possession of a Chaotic spellcaster’s spellbook. After several weeks of study, Baldur learns tenebrosity (a 1st level black magic spell) and deathless minion (a 2nd level black magic spell). He acquires 3 corruption points, 1 for learning tenebrosity and 2 for learning deathless minion. When Baldur is caught with the Chaotic spellbook, men-at-arms from the local militia (Neutral men) are sent to arrest him for sorcery. Baldur casts burning sparks (a 2nd level grey magic spell) against his would-be captors, killing one guard and wounding two others. He gains 1 corruption point for casting grey magic to harm sapient Neutrals. Baldur then casts deathless minion to animate the slain guard, gaining another 1 corruption point for casting a black magic spell. After making his escape, Baldur has accumulated a total of 5 corruption points.  

When a caster accumulates a number of corruption points equal to his Wisdom score, his alignment shifts one step towards Chaotic. When a caster accumulates twice his Wisdom score in corruption, his alignment shifts a second step towards Chaotic. Characters who begin Neutral are not affected by the first stage of corruption, and characters who begin Chaotic are not affected by the first two stages of corruption.

When a caster accumulates a number of corruption points equal to three times his Wisdom score, and for each additional multiple of his Wisdom score the caster accumulates in corruption points thereafter, he acquires a corrupting weakness.  The Judge will randomly determine or pick from the list below:

1.	Disfigured: Sorcerous studies have begun to make the caster a monstrous figure, leaving him misshapen limbs, clawed hands or feet, hideous scarring, strangely colored eyes, and so on. Each disfigurement imposes a -2 reaction rolls with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment.
2.	Distrusted: Lore best left unstudied has twisted the caster’s demeanor and personality. A reaction roll with sapient creatures of Lawful or Neutral alignment can never achieve a friendly (12+) result. Each time this weakness is selected thereafter, reduce the best possible reaction roll by one further step.
3.	Enervated: The caster’s exploration of sinister sorcery has sapped his soul of strength and vigor. His Constitution is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs.
4.	Frightening to Beasts: The caster’s corruption is unsettling to animals. They growl, hiss, rear up, and otherwise make their displeasure known whenever he is within 10’. The caster suffers a -4 reaction roll when encountering animals or giant animals.  He cannot ride normal mounts. Characters with Beast Friendship proficiency (or related class powers) can detect something is unnatural about the caster, but do not suffer a reaction roll penalty. If the caster himself had Beast Friendship proficiency, the proficiency’s effects now only help when dealing with wild predators and scavengers, such as wolves and vultures.
5.	Haunted: Whispers from the beyond plague the caster. They are difficult to ignore, and impose a -2 penalty to hear noise throws and -1 penalty to initiative and surprise rolls. The penalty is cumulative each time this weakness occurs.
 
6.	Mad: So disturbing are the caster’s dark secrets that he has begun to lose his grip on reality. Each day he must make a saving throw versus Spells or go mad for 1-10 hours. The caster’s first saving throw against madness is at +20, but each consecutive saving throw is one point less advantaged. When the caster goes mad, he falls under the Judge’s control for 1d10 hours, during which time his behavior is entirely unpredictable. The day after a bout of madness, the caster resumes his saving throws with a +20 bonus.
7.	Mutated: The corrupting influences of dark magic have begun to warp the caster’s body. The first time this weakness occurs, roll 1d10 on the Player’s Companion Magical Mutations sub-table. The second time it occurs, roll 1d10+1. The third time it occurs, roll 1d10+2, and so on.
8.	Nocturnal: Creatures of darkness and evil hunt by night, and sleep by day. So too does the caster. He cannot regain spells unless he sleeps during the day. Due to his nocturnal habits, he suffers a penalty of -2 to all throws when in sunlight. This penalty is increased by an additional 2 points each time this weakness occurs.
9.	Obsessed: The caster’s self-control and will begin to erode in the face of ongoing corruption. His Wisdom is reduced by 2 points each time this weakness occurs. Note that this result may cause the caster to acquire more weaknesses by increasing the ratio of his corruption points to his Wisdom!
10.	Sleepless: Haunted by nightmares and disturbing visions of the grave, the caster finds it hard to sleep. Each time he attempts to rest, he must roll 1d6. On a 1, the caster tosses and turns all night, regaining no hit points and recovering no spells. The chance of sleeplessness increases by 1 each time this weakness occurs, to a maximum of five times.

If desired, a Lawful or Neutral character may accept a corrupting weakness in lieu of an alignment shift. In this case, the weakness would represent a side effect from the character’s struggle to resist the temptations of evil.

The maximum number of weaknesses a caster (or ceremonialist) may have is equal to the highest level spell (or ceremony) in his repertoire. Such a caster is as depraved as he can be, given his knowledge; additional corruption cannot taint him further until he unlocks even darker secrets (e.g. learns higher level spells). He still accumulates corruption points, however.

EXAMPLE: Baldur is a Neutral 7th level Nobiran wizard with 11 Wisdom. Over several months of studying a Chaotic spellbook, Baldur accumulates 11 corruption points. This is sufficient to cause Baldur’s alignment to shift one step, but because he is Neutral he ignores this first stage of corruption. Later, on a dangerous adventure, he casts several black magic spells, and accumulates 22 corruption points. Baldur’s alignment now shifts another step, and he becomes Chaotic aligned. <br>
With his new alignment, evil deeds come easier to him, and Baldur soon racks up more corruption. When he accumulates 33 corruption points, Baldur acquires his first corrupting weakness. The Judge rolls a 1 on 1d10, indicating that Baldur is now disfigured. Because Baldur has been casting a lot of necromancy spells, the Judge decides that Baldur has taken on a corpse-like appearance, with pale yellowish skin, gaunt flesh, and reddish eyes. Baldur now suffers a -2 reaction roll with sapient Lawful and Neutral creatures. <br>
The disfigured Baldur is now shunned by all good creature and sees little point in “playing nice” anymore. He soon accumulates many more corruption points. At 44, 55, and 66 corruption points, he accumulates his second, third, and fourth corrupting weakness. He becomes nocturnal (-2 penalty to throws in sunlight), haunted (-2 to hear noise, -1 initiative and surprise rolls), and mutated – with a roll of 8 on the Magical Mutation sub-table indicating he grows large fangs which prevent intelligible human speech (though not spells). At 8th level he accumulates 80 corruption points, but he cannot acquire more than four weaknesses, because the highest level spell he can cast is 4th. When Baldur reaches 9th level, and becomes capable of 5th level spells, he has acquired 103 corruption points. He immediately acquires his fifth weakness – another result of nocturnal means that he now suffers -4 penalty to throws in sunlight.

Characters who cannot cast spells or perform ceremonies are less likely to acquire corruption, but their lack of magical training leaves them more vulnerable to corruption. Possible sources of corruption for non-casters include spending time in sinkholes of evil (p. XX), using evil magic items (p. XX), or suffering corrupting dreams (p. XX). There is no limit to the number of corrupting weaknesses a non-caster may have.

#### Identifying the Shade of Magic

The Eldritch Spells list has categorized the existing body of spells into black, grey, and white. To determine the shade of a newly-created spell, consult the checklists below. Always start with the black magic checklist, then proceed to the grey magic checklist, then to the white magic checklist.
 
The following types of spells should be considered black magic:

*	Death and necromancy spells of any sort, except those which exclusively harm the undead.
*	Detection spells reversed to conceal black magic (e.g. undetectable curse).
*	Enchantment spells which are capable of charming or commanding sapient creatures for more than an hour. Having the power to enslave the will of sapient creatures for long periods of time is inherently corrupting. (Display of power, voice of persuasion, and voice of command are not black magic because they have a duration of an hour or less.)
*	Enchantment spells which cause fear in living creatures, unless limited to target evil creatures. (Inspire awe is not black magic because it only targets evil creatures.) Causing fear and terror is an inherently black deed.
*	Illusion spells which send phantasmal killers against the target. Causing fear and terror is, again, a black deed.
*	Healing spells reversed to cause harm (e.g. cause light wounds or cause disease). Perverting healing magic is always black.
*	Protection spells reversed to operate against good creatures (e.g. protection from good) or harm the target (bane).
*	Summoning spells which communicate with or summon creatures from thin air (other planes of existence); or summoning spells which summon Lawful or sapient Neutral creatures which are compelled to serve the caster or any Chaotic creatures.
*	Wall spells with necromantic components (e.g. wall of corpses).

The following types of spells should be considered grey magic:

*	Blast spells of any type.
*	Enchantment spells which are capable of charming or commanding sapient creatures, but not for more than an hour; and other enchantment spells which are not limited to targeting evil creatures.
*	Illusion spells which render the target invisible or inaudible, or which can be disbelieved.
*	Movement spells which can affect objects or unwilling targets.
*	Transmogrification spells which can affect unwilling targets.   
*	Wall spells of any type except walls of corpses.

The following types of spells should be considered white magic:
*	Death spells which exclusively harm the undead.
*	Detection spells which are not black.
*	Enchantment spells which are limited to targeting evil creatures.
*	Healing spells, except if reversed to cause harm.
*	Illusion spells which cannot be disbelieved, except for inaudibility and invisibility.
*	Movement spells which can only affect willing targets.
*	Protection spells, except if reversed to operate against “good” creatures or to harm the target.
*	Transmogrification spells which can only affect objects or willing targets.
*	Summoning spells in which the creature(s) summoned must arrive by means of their own locomotion from the nearest lair and are either sapient Lawful creatures which serve Lawful casters; or are unintelligent Neutral creatures.
*	Any other spell which is not black or grey.

**Robert E. Howard Memorial Rule (Optional):** In some heroic fantasy worlds, the taint of eldritch magic is very strong. When this optional rule applies, all grey magic spells are considered black magic.  If the Robert E. Howard Memorial Rule is in play, the maximum repertoire of each level of spells or ceremonies known by eldritch casters or ceremonialists should be increased by two.

**H.P. Lovecraft Memorial Rule (Optional):** Eldritch magic is of such a dark origin that there are no “pure” spells all. When this optional rule applies, all eldritch spells are considered black magic.  If the H. P. Lovecraft Memorial Rule is in play, the maximum repertoire of each level of spells or ceremonies known by eldritch casters or ceremonialists should be increased by four.

EXAMPLE: A 1st level Zaharan Sorcerer has a maximum repertoire of two 1st level spells. If the Robert E. Howard Memorial Rule applies, his maximum repertoire is increased to four 1st level spells. If the H.P. Lovecraft Memorial Rule applies, his maximum repertoire is increased to six 1st level spells. When the Zaharan Sorcerer reaches 5th level, his maximum repertoire will be three 1st, two 2nd, and one 3rd level spell. Under the Robert E. Howard Memorial Rule, his repertoire would be five 1st, four 2nd, and three 3rd, while under the H.P. Lovecraft Memorial Rule, his repertoire would be seven 1st, six 2nd, and five 3rd.


## Places of Power

*“The Earth is also terrible, and dark, and cruel. The rabbit shrieks dying in the green meadows. The mountains clench their great hands full of hidden fire. And where men worship these things and abase themselves before them, there evil breeds; there places are made in the world where darkness gathers, places given over wholly to the Ones whom we call Nameless, the ancient and holy Powers of the Earth before the Light, the powers of the dark, of ruin, of madness...”* – Ged, in The Tomb of Atuan (Ursula K. LeGuin)

In the worlds of heroic fantasy there lie places of power, where the border between the spheres is thin and magic gathers. Sometimes these are places of death, where shadows linger and undead lurk. Others are places of law and light, where divine power illuminates those who dwell within. And there are places of raw elemental power, majestic mountains, deep wells, flows of lava, where the elemental sphere holds sway.

There are six sources of power: chaos, law, elemental air, elemental earth, elemental fire, and elemental water. There are three ranks of power: minor, major, and supreme. The interaction of source and rank yields 18 different types of places of power, shown on the Places of Power table. The game effects of each are detailed below the table.

| Source  |	Minor |	Major |	Supreme |	Name
| :
| Chaos |	Shadowed  |	Blighted  |	Forsaken  |	Sinkhole of Evil
| Law |	Illuminated |	Hallowed  |	Sacrosanct  |	Pinnacle of Good
| Air |	Gusting |	Roaring |	Howling |	Aerie of Elemental Air
| Earth |	Resilient |	Enduring  |	Unbreakable |	Edifice of Elemental Earth
| Fire  |	Smoldering  |	Flaming |	Blazing |	Furnace of Elemental Fire
| Water |	Azure |	Cerulean  |	Ultramarine |	Well of Elemental Water


### Sinkholes of Evil

Places corrupted by the energies of the Outer Darkness are known as sinkholes of evil. Profane powers and undead creatures are stronger there, while the divine and the living are weakened. Sinkholes of evil can develop anywhere that death and decay predominate. Sinkholes of evil can be shadowed, blighted, or forsaken. The table below summarizes the effects of the various types of sinkholes of evil.


| Effect  |	Shadowed  |	Blighted  |	Forsaken
| :
| Corruption  |	1 point/season  |	1 point/month |	1 point/week
| Corpse Reanimation  |	10%/1d12 months |	20%/1d4 days  |	80%/1d4 rounds
| Black Magic Spell Effects |	+2 class levels |	+2 class levels |	+2 class level
| White Magic Spell Effects |	No Effect |	No Effect |	-2 class levels
| Turning Undead  |	No Effect |	-4 class levels |	Forbidden
| Necromancy / Ceremonial Black Magic |	+1 bonus  |	+2 bonus  |	+3 bonus
| Undead in Sinkhole  |	No Effect |	No Effect |	+2 attack, save, damage, AC
| Animating Undead  |	No Effect |	No Effect |	+2 hp/HD, 2x normal HD created
| Blood sacrifice |	Yes |	Yes |	Yes

#### Shadowed Sinkholes

Shadowed sinkholes develop from two sources of corruption: Chaotic altars (such as those in evil shrines, temples, or churches) and places of death (such as cemeteries, catacombs, and battlegrounds).

Chaotic altars create shadowed sinkholes as soon as they are erected. The size of the shadowed sinkhole around the altar will be 100 square feet per 100gp spent on the altar. For instance, a 10,000gp altar would create a 100’ x 100’ shadowed sinkhole around the altar. At the Judge’s discretion, meeting the gp value of the altar might require special components or blood sacrifices instead of standard treasure.
 
Places of death create shadowed sinkholes naturally over time. The annual percentage chance of such an area becoming shadowed is equal to number of dead interred in the area divided by the area’s size in square feet, rounded up. For instance, a small 50’ x 50’ cemetery with 25 graves has a 1% chance of becoming shadowed each year. An enormous cemetery such as the real-world Wadi Al Salam (5 million dead across 64 million square feet) has an 8% chance of becoming shadowed each year. Once the shadowed sinkhole develops, the size of the shadowed sinkhole will be 100 square feet per 20 dead interred in the place. However, a sinkhole of evil will not develop if the dead are cremated by a Lawful divine spellcaster, or if one or more shrine(s) to Lawful powers are erected on the site. The Lawful shrine(s) must have a gp value of at least 5gp per dead interred in order to prevent the area from becoming shadowed.

Corpses in shadowed sinkholes have a 10% chance to return as undead in 1d12 months unless their bodies are burned. Black magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Characters performing necromancy or ceremonial black magic in a shadowed sinkhole gain a +1 bonus to their throws. A shadowed sinkhole can also be used for blood sacrifice (described in Chapter 7).

Spending time in a corrupt place can itself cause corruption. For each season that a character resides in a shadowed sinkhole, his number of corruption points is increased by 1.

#### Blighted Sinkholes

When a chaotic altar stands on a shadowed place of death, a blighted sinkhole develops. The blighted sinkhole will extend only within those regions that are shadowed by both the altar and the place of death. An area affected by one, but not both, sources of corruption is merely shadowed.

Corpses in blighted sinkholes have a 20% chance to return as undead in 1d4 days unless their bodies are burned. Black magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters turn undead as if four class levels lower. Characters performing necromancy or ceremonial black magic in a blighted sinkhole gain a +2 bonus to their throws. A blighted sinkhole can be used for blood sacrifice. For each month that a character resides in a blighted sinkhole, his number of corruption points is increased by 1.

#### Forsaken Sinkholes

A blighted area might, through some awful juxtaposition of the planes or terrible ritual magic, become forsaken. Forsaken sinkholes are pits of darkness where the vilest creatures and foulest magic are found. Such places are very rare (Judge’s discretion).

Corpses in forsaken areas have an 80% chance to return as undead in 1d4 rounds unless their bodies are burned. Black magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. White magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels lower than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters may not turn undead. Any undead in forsaken areas gain a +2 bonus to attack throws, saving throws, damage rolls, and AC. Characters performing necromancy or black ceremonial magic in a blighted sinkhole gain a +3 bonus to their throws. Any undead created in forsaken areas gain a permanent +2 hit point per Hit Die, and animate dead spells cast in forsaken sinkholes create twice the normal number of Hit Dice of undead. A forsaken sinkhole can be used for blood sacrifice. For each week that a character resides in a forsaken sinkhole, his number of corruption points is increased by 1.

#### Cleansing Sinkholes

A bless spell will temporarily decrease the effect of a sinkhole within a 100’ diameter area for the duration of the spell. While subject to bless, the affected area is cleansed if shadowed; shadowed if blighted; and blighted if forsaken. A vial of holy water can be sprinkled on a 10’ diameter area with the same effect as a bless spell.

To permanently cleanse a sinkhole of evil, the source of corruption must be removed. If the sinkhole is being generated by a chaotic altar, the altar must be destroyed. A chaotic altar can be destroyed magically, with dispel evil; or destroyed physically by smashing it and then either pouring holy water or casting bless on the broken remains. This will remove the sinkhole created by the altar.  

If the sinkhole is generated by a place of death, the sinkhole can be instantly cleansed with dispel evil. However, the area will eventually become shadowed again over time. To permanently cleanse a sinkhole created by a place of death, a Lawful divine spellcaster must cremate the dead interred therein, or erect a shrine to the Lawful powers of appropriate value.

Cleansing a blighted sinkhole, with a chaotic altar standing on a place of death, requires that both sources of corruption be dealt with separately.

A forsaken sinkhole can only be cleansed by ritual magic. As such areas develop very rarely, the magic to cleanse them is almost always forgotten in between each such occurrence, and must be researched anew by the forces of Law.


### Pinnacles of Good

Places of beauty and serenity, respites from the chaos and corruption of the world around them, are known as pinnacles of good. The forces of life are stronger there, while dark forces are kept at bay. Light is brighter, sounds are crisper, and colors more vivid; harmony and a sense of order prevail. Pinnacles of good can be illuminated, hallowed, or sacrosanct. The table below summarizes the effects of the various types:

| Effect  |	Illuminated	| Hallowed  |	Sacrosanct
| :
|Purification of Corruption |	1 point/season  |	1/month |	1/week
| White Magic Spell Effects |	+2 class levels |	+2 class levels |	+2 class level
| Black Magic Spell Effects |	No Effect |	No Effect |	-2 class levels
| Turning Undead  |	No Effect |	+4 class levels	| Automatic
| White Ceremonial / Ritual Magic | 	+1 bonus |	+2 bonus  |	+3 bonus
| Natural Healing |	+1 level  |	+2 levels |	+4 levels

#### Illuminated Pinnacles

Illuminated pinnacles develop from two sources: Lawful altars (such as those in lawful shrines, temples, or churches) and the dwelling places of powerful good creatures.

Lawful altars create illuminated pinnacles as soon as they are erected. The size of the illuminated pinnacle around the altar will be 100 square feet per 100gp spent on the altar. For instance, a 10,000gp altar would create a 100’ x 100’ illuminated pinnacles around the altar. At the Judge’s discretion, meeting the gp value of the altar might require special components or divine power  instead of standard treasure.

Powerful good creatures create illuminated pinnacles naturally over time through their presence. For these purposes, “powerful good creatures” include: fantastic creatures of lawful alignment; lawful spellcasters and ceremonialists of any level; and 2nd level or higher characters of a lawful class such as paladin. The creature(s) must reside in a particular place more-or-less continuously for a year for a place to become illuminated. The annual percentage chance of a good creature’s dwelling place becoming illuminated is equal to the HD value of the good creatures residing there divided by the area’s size in square feet, rounded up. Once the Illuminated pinnacle develops, the entire area will be illuminated. The Judge must use his discretion in determining what constitutes a creature’s dwelling place. It might be, e.g., a treant’s copse of trees, a unicorn’s grove, or a patriarch’s high temple.

EXAMPLE: The giant roc Majid (36 HD) dwells in a 50’ x 50’ aerie at the top of a high peak. The Judge decides the aerie constitutes the roc’s dwelling place. Each year, the chance of Majid’s aerie becoming illuminated is (36 / 2,500 = .014) 2%.

Characters resting within an illuminated pinnacle recover from wounds more quickly. While within the pinnacle, the character’s base healing rate is improved by one step on the Base Healing Rate table. White magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters performing white ceremonial or ritual magic in an illuminated pinnacle gain a +1 bonus to their throws. Finally, the serenity of a pinnacle of good can remove the stain of corruption from a character, provided the character’s corruption has not advanced too far. For each season that a lawful or neutral character resides in an illuminated pinnacle, his number of corruption points is reduced by 1.

#### Hallowed Pinnacles

When a lawful altar is built in an illuminated dwelling place of good, a hallowed pinnacle develops. The hallowed pinnacle will extend only within those parts of the dwelling place that are illuminated by the altar. An area affected by one, but not both, sources of good is merely illuminated.

While within a hallowed pinnacle, a character’s base healing rate is improved by two steps on the Base Healing Rate table.  White magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters capable of turning undead do so as if four class levels higher. Lawful characters performing white ceremonial or ritual magic in a hallowed pinnacle gain a +2 bonus to their throws. Finally, for each month that a lawful or neutral character resides in a hallowed pinnacle, his number of corruption points is reduced by 1.

#### Sacrosanct Pinnacles

A hallowed area might, through some fortunate juxtaposition of the planes or miraculous ritual, become sacrosanct. Sacrosanct pinnacles are transcendent regions of law and power. Such places are very rare (Judge’s discretion).

While within a sacrosanct pinnacle, a character’s base healing rate is improved by three steps on the Base Healing Rate table. White magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Lawful characters capable of turning undead automatically turn undead encountered there (earning a T result if a roll would normally be required, and a D result otherwise). Lawful characters performing ceremonial or ritual magic in the sacrosanct pinnacle gain a +3 bonus to their throws. Black magic spell effects are calculated as if the casters were two class levels lower than their actual level of experience. Finally, for each week that a lawful or neutral character resides in a sacrosanct pinnacle, his number of corruption points is reduced by 1.


#### Depurifying Pinnacles

A bane spell will temporarily decrease the effect of a pinnacle within a 100’ diameter area for the duration of the spell. While subject to bane, the affected area is regular if illuminated; illuminated if hallowed; and hallowed if sacrosanct. A vial of unholy water can be sprinkled on a 10’ diameter area with the same effect as a bane spell.

To permanently destroy a pinnacle of good, the source of purity must be removed. If the pinnacle is being generated by a lawful altar, the altar must be destroyed. A lawful altar can be destroyed magically, with dispel good; or destroyed physically by smashing it and then either pouring unholy water or casting bane on the broken remains. This will remove the pinnacle created by the altar.  

If the pinnacle is generated by the residence of good creatures, the pinnacle can be instantly depurified with dispel good. However, the area will eventually become illuminated again over time. To permanently depurify a pinnacle created by good creatures, the creatures must be slain or driven off.

Depurifying a hallowed pinnacle requires that both sources of purity be dealt with separately. A sacrosanct pinnacle can only be depurified by ritual magic. As such areas develop very rarely, the magic to cleanse them is almost always forgotten in between each such occurrence, and must be researched anew by the forces of Chaos.


### Places of Elemental Power

Many places of power are created by the influence of the elemental spheres of air, earth, fire, and water.  Elemental places of power develop naturally, in areas which are shaped or influenced by the elements. Each of the elementals has its own type of place: aeries of elemental air, edifices of elemental earth, furnaces of elemental fire, and wells of elemental water. The table below summarizes the effects of the various ranks of elemental places of power.

Places of elemental power develop in places of sublime elemental majesty. Places of sublime elemental majesty occur naturally in the wilderness. Real-life examples might include God’s Window in South Africa (air), the Wind Cathedral in Namibia (air), Maruyama Caldera in Aogashima (fire), the Door to Hell in Turkmenistan (fire), the Cave of the Crystals in Mexico (earth), the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland (earth), the Fairy Pools on the Isle of Skye (water), and the Great Blue Hole off Belize (water).  

Places of elemental power should be rare. Of the 165 lairs in Lairs & Encounters, only 6 included elemental places of power, and all were minor. On a continental map (1,200 24-mile hexes), the Judge should place 1 supreme and 12 major elemental places of power of each element. On a regional map (1,200 6-mile hexes), the Judge should place 1 major and 12 minor elemental places of power for each element.  

The size of places of elemental power can vary widely. To determine randomly, roll 1d6: 1-3, Small, 3d6 x 500 square feet; 4-5 Large, 3d6 x 50,000 square feet; 6 Huge, 3d6 x 5,000,000 square feet.

**Note:** The Judge may wonder how we decided how many places of elemental power there are in the world. On our own Earth, there are 11 naturally-burning eternal flames, 600 active volcanoes, and 1000 active geysers in the world - that suggests 1,611 places of elemental fire spread across the earth’s 5,300,000 square mile land mass. That’s one place of elemental fire per 3,295 square miles. Since each 6-mile hex is 32 square miles, that’s one place of elemental fire per 102 hexes, or about 12 places on a typical 1,200-hex regional map.

| Effect  |	Minor |	Major |	Supreme
| Elemental Incursion |	10%/1d12 days/1d4 days  |	20%/1d12 days/1d4 weeks |	80%/1d12 days/Permanent

#### Minor Places of Elemental Power

Characters within the place who perform ceremonial magic or magical research of the place’s element gain a +1 bonus to their throws. Spell effects of the place’s element are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. If the place is left unoccupied, there is a 10% chance every 1d12 days that a group of creatures native to that element’s sphere will manifest in the place. These creatures will return to their sphere of existence after 1d4 days have elapsed.

#### Major Places of Elemental Power

Characters within the place who perform ceremonial magic or magical research of the place’s element gain a +2 bonus to their throws. Spell effects of the place’s element are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. If the place is left unoccupied, there is a 20% chance every 1d12 days that a group of elemental creatures of the place’s type will manifest in the place. These creatures will return to their sphere of existence after 1d4 weeks have elapsed.

#### Supreme Places of Elemental Power

Characters within the place who perform ceremonial magic or magical research of the place’s element gain a +3 bonus to their throws. Spell effects of the place’s element are calculated as if the casters were two class levels higher than their actual level of experience. Spell effects of any other elements are calculated as if the casters were two class levels lower than their actual level of experience. While in a supreme place of elemental power, creatures native to that element’s sphere gain a +2 bonus to attack throws, saving throws, damage rolls, and AC. Summoning spells cast in places of supreme elemental power summon twice the normal number of Hit Dice of elementals of that type, and the summoned elementals will have +2 hit point per Hit Die. If the place is left unoccupied, there is an 80% chance every 1d12 days that a group of elemental creatures of the place’s type will manifest in the place. These creatures will not return to their sphere of existence until dispelled or destroyed.


## Spellsinging

*He chanted a song of wizardry, / Of piercing, opening, of treachery / Revealing, uncovering, betraying.* – The Lay of Leithian in The Silmarillion (J.R.R. Tolkien)


Spellsinging is an alternative way to perform magic that is more fluid and flexible than traditional spellcasting. Spellsinging was inspired by the magic of Middle Earth, as used by Tom Bombadil and Lúthien Tinúviel; the magic of the Kalevala, itself based on traditional Finnish spellsongs; the magic of the Greek hero Orpheus; the magic of Blue in the Apprentice Adept series; and more. It could also represent other fluid types of spellcasting, such as the Wheel of Time’s channeling or the linguistic magic of the wizards of Earthsea.

The following rules explain how spellsinging works. The Elven Spellsinger class in these rules is built on these mechanics, but the Judge may convert other classes to spellsingers if desired. The Heroic Secrets chapter (p. XX) has further details on building and converting classes.

### Spell Points

Spellsingers perform magic by spending spell points (SP) rather than by expending daily spell castings. The spellsingers’ use of spell points gives them the flexibility to choose to cast a large number of low level spells, a small number of high level spells, or any combination in between. The number of spell points that a spellsinger has is determined by his casting progression and level of experience, as shown on the Spell Points Per Day table.

Spellsingers recover their spell points in the same way spellcasters recover their daily spell castings, by spending eight hours resting without interruption and one hour concentrating on prayer or study. Spell points can only be recovered by resting once every 24 hours. However, in some circumstances spellsingers can recover spell points more quickly by tapping ambient magic (see p. XX).


**Spells Points per Day by Level of Experience**

| Caster Progression  |	1|	2|	3|	4|	5|	6|	7|	8|	9|	10|	11|	12|	13|	14

### Spellsinging Repertoire

Like other eldritch casters, a spellsinger’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A spellsinger’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus, and functions exactly like an arcane/eldritch caster’s repertoire in all respects. Spellsingers can cast spells that are not in their repertoire, however, by extemporaneously singing spells (see below).


### Singing Spells

Each spell costs a certain number of spell points to sing. The higher the level of the spell, the more points it costs. The Spell Point Costs table describes each spell’s cost.

When a spell is sung in combat, the spellsinger must announce the intention to sing the spell prior to initiative being determined at the beginning of a round. Spell points are spent when the intention to sing the spell is declared. Should an opponent successfully deal damage to the character or if the character is required to roll a saving throw and fails prior to casting a spell, the spell is disrupted and the spell points are wasted.

Like a traditional spellcaster, a spellsinger must be able to move his hands and speak freely in order to work magic. A spellsinger cannot sing spells if he is gagged, his hands are tied, or he is in an area under the effects of a noiselessness spell. (A spellsinger who possesses Quiet Magic proficiency can sing spells quietly by subvocalizing, but still cannot do so if under noiselessness.) Except where otherwise noted, a spellsinger must have the intended target of a spell within visual range while singing a spell. If after beginning to sing, a spellsinger loses his ability to move his hands and speak freely, or loses his line of sight on the intended target, the song is disrupted and the spell points are wasted.

| Spell Level |	Spell Point Cost
| :
| 1st |	1
| 2nd | 	2
| 3rd | 	3
| 4th | 	5
| 5th | 	7
| 6th | 	10

#### Extemporaneous Spellsinging

Just as a skilled musician can improvise a musical composition, a skilled spellsinger can extemporaneously sing spells from outside his repertoire. When a spellsinger decides to extemporaneously sing a spell, he may choose an existing spell from outside his repertoire, or design a new spell using the Spell Power Guidelines in Player’s Companion. Spellsingers may wish to work up some possible spells for likely circumstances or needs in advance.

In order to include any given effect in his extemporaneous spell, the spellsinger must already have one or more spells with the same basic effect(s) in his repertoire. In order to include any given element (earth, fire, etc.) in his extemporaneous spell, the spellsinger must already have one or more elemental spells with the same basic effect(s) in his repertoire.

EXAMPLE: Arwen would like to extemporaneously sing a blast spell that hurls a bolt of fire that deals damage. Unfortunately, the only damage-dealing blast spell in her repertoire is fangs of the earth, which is an elemental earth spell. She could extemporaneously sing other damaging-dealing earth blasts, but she cannot extemporaneously sing a damage-dealing fire blast.

Apart from the restriction on effects and elements, the spellsinger may otherwise design the spell with any desired parameters of range, target, duration, and saving throw. An extemporaneous spell may even be of a higher level than those known by the caster, although higher level spells will be quite difficult (or impossible) to successfully sing.

In order to successfully sing an extemporaneous spell, a spellsinger must make a spellsinging throw. If the extemporized spell is being sung in combat, the spellsinging throw is made on the spellsinger’s initiative number. The target value for the throw is based on the caster level cross-indexed against the spell level, as shown on the Spellsinging table below. Modify the roll by the spellsinger’s CHA modifier. Add +1 to the spellsinger’s roll for each rank of Performance (singing) or Performance (chanting) that the character possesses. If the spell is tapping a place of power, apply an additional -4 penalty. If the throw succeeds, the spell has been successfully cast and immediately takes effect. If the throw fails, the spell has been miscast; all of the spell points expended on it are lost to no effect. A natural roll of 1 always fails and may cause a mishap (see below).


| Spell Level |	1|	2|	3|	4|	5|	6|	7|	8|	9|	10|	11|	12|	13|	14
| ----:
| 1st|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+|	4+|	3+|	2+|	1+
| 2nd|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+|	4+|	3+
| 3rd	|18+|	17+|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+
| 4th|	20+|	19+|	18+|	17+|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+
| 5th|	-|	-|	20+|	19+|	18+|	17+|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+
| 6th|	-|	-|	-|	-|	20+|	19+|	18+|	17+|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+

“-“ indicates the spellsinger cannot cast spells of that level with a spellsinging throw.


EXAMPLE: Arwen, a 9th level elven spellsinger with CHA 16 and one rank of Performance (singing), is on a scouting mission when she spots a huge encampment of kobolds, ripe for destruction with a magical blast! Unfortunately, her only blast spell is fangs of earth, which will deal a lot of damage to a small number of targets – the opposite of what she needs. She decides to extemporize a spell that can deal a small amount of damage to a lot of targets. She consults the Player’s Companion to design her extemporaneous spell. She decides on a 4th level eldritch spell dealing 2d6 points of damage to all targets in a 30’ diameter area of effect, with a 150’ range, instantaneous duration, and saving throw allowed for half damage (base cost 27 x 0.25 x 5 x 1 x 1 x 0.75 x 1.5 = 38). The 4th level spell costs her 5 SP. The target value for her spellsinging throw is 12+. She gains a +2 bonus from CHA and a +1 bonus from Performance (singing), so she’ll need  a 9+ on the die. The result of Arwen’s roll is a 14, so she successfully sings the spell.

Extemporaneous spellsinging can be a powerful tool, but it requires a significant degree of system mastery from the player and Judge to use. In general, extemporizing spells is intended to allow a spellsinger to flexibly apply what he knows, rather than extemporaneously cast what he does not know. As magic is fickle and no mere mortal can always comprehend its workings, the Judge may veto or re-design any extemporaneous spell at his complete discretion where necessary for balance and fun.

### Tapping Power

When a spellcaster casts a spell, he uses his personal power to draw on and manipulate the much larger stores of power that are available (to those with the talent) from ambient divine and elemental sources. Spellsingers do this, too, but they have the additional ability to draw on those ambient sources directly whenever they are within places of power. This is known as tapping power and allows the spellsinger to cast certain types of spells without using his own reserves.

In order to tap a place of power, a spellsinger must first attune to it. Attuning to a place of payer takes 8 hours and requires a successful magical research throw.  Only one creature can be attuned to any given particular place of power, and each spellsinger can only be attuned to one place. If a new creature attunes to a place, the prior creature’s attunement is a disrupted.
 
Once the spellsinger has attuned to the place, he can tap its power to pay for the cost of some spells sung within it.  The amount of spell points available each day depends on the size and rank of the place of power, as shown on the Ambient Power table. Round to the nearest whole number, rounding 0.5 up. Places of power that are larger than 10,000 square feet should be treated as multiple adjacent places of power.  Spell points drawn from a place of power cannot be stored or used to “recharge”.  

Spell points from a place of power can only be used to pay for spells appropriate to the place’s type, as shown on the Place and Effect Type table. The spellsinger must make a spellsinging throw when casting a spell using a place of power. The target value for the throw is based on the caster level cross-indexed against the spell level, as shown on the Spellsinging table. Modify the roll by the spellsinger’s CHA modifier. Add +1 to the spellsinger’s roll for each rank of Performance (singing) or Performance (chanting) that the character possesses. If the spell is extemporaneous, apply an additional -4 penalty to the throw.

If the throw succeeds, the spell has been successfully cast and immediately takes effect. If the throw fails, the spell has been miscast; the place of power’s SP are expended to no effect (other than some showy elemental special effects, perhaps). A natural roll of 1 always fails and may cause a mishap (see below).

EXAMPLE: Arwen has found the Sky of the Earth, a resilient edifice of elemental earth that is 100’ in diameter (7,850 square feet). After attuning to the edifice, Arwen can tap it to cast elemental earth spells costing up to (7,850 / 2000) 4 SP per day – enough for, e.g., four 1st-level spells, two 2nd-level spells, or one 3rd and one 1st level spell. She will have to make a spellsinging throw each time she sings a spell using the place of power’s spell points, however.


**Ambient Power**<br>

| Rank  |	Power / Day
| --:
| Minor |	1 SP per 2,000 square feet
| Major |	1 SP per 1,000 square feet
| Supreme |	1 SP per 200 square feet

| Type of Place |	Type of Effect
| :
| Pinnacle of Good  |	Any white magic
| Sinkhole of Evil  |	Any black magic
| Aerie of Air  |	Any elemental air magic
| Edifice of Earth  |	Any elemental earth magic
| Furnace of Fire |	Any elemental fire magic
| Well of Water |	Any elemental water magic


### Spellsinging Mishaps

To find out if a mishap occurs, the spellsinger must make a mishap throw - another spellsinging throw with the same modifiers and target value as the throw she just made. If the mishap throw also results in a failure, then a mishap occurs.

When a mishap occurs, the spellsinger must roll 1d10 on the Spellsinging Mishaps table and suffer the effect listed in the column matching the degree of mishap. The degree of the mishap depends on the level of the spell that caused the mishap. If the spell was 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, a minor mishap occurs. If the spell was 4th or 5th level, a major mishap occurs. If the spell was 6th level, a catastrophic mishap occurs.

## Ceremonial Magic

*Adamancus of Zaar set about the dark ritual without delay. First, with a pointed Rod of Power, he traced a luminous circle about the column whereto Sumia was led helpless in the invisible bonds. Another such circle he set about Shangoth… Having set in place the circles of protection, he next kindled a Hell Flame on a low altar of black emerald. The weird crimson flame smoldered a few inches about the surface of the gemlike substance… Now he was ready to begin the last ritual. Arming himself with potent talismans whereon terrific runes of Elder Lore were graven deep on pendent disks of rarest orichalc and precious jazite, he began the great conjuration… He chanted a series of names in that uncouth language of the magi for which the lips of men were never shapen to speak…  The thunderous invocation rose, shaking the room with the seism impact of these terrific Names of Power… and a smoky wraith began to form out of empty air!* – Thongor Against the Gods (Lin Carter)

Ceremonial magic is the art of performing ceremonies – complex rituals that rely on lengthy chants, symbolic patterns, magical reagents, and complicated movements to cast spells. Ceremonies may only be performed by characters of special classes (of which the occultist class on p. XX is one example) or by spellcasters who have taken the Ceremonial Magic proficiency. Collectively, characters capable of using ceremonial magic are called ceremonialists.

Like spells, ceremonies have unique names, types, and effects, with levels that measure how powerful they are. The name, type, and level of a ceremony are always identical to those of the spell that the ceremony casts. Thus, a bane-rune ceremony would be a 1st level eldritch ceremony, because bane-rune itself is a 1st level eldritch spell. Since this rulebook focuses on eldritch magic, all of the ceremonies and ceremonialists discussed herein are eldritch, but Judges could create arcane and divine ceremonialist for their campaigns if desired.

Ceremonial magic is well-suited to settings inspired by the weird tales of Robert E. Howard, Lin Carter, Clark Ashton Smith, and H. P. Lovecraft, as well as to campaigns influenced by historical occult practices.


### Ceremonial Magic versus Cast Magic

Ceremonial magic has two primary advantages over cast magic. First, it requires no magical talent to become a ceremonialist, merely knowledge and diligence. As a result, it is easier to become a ceremonialist than to become a spellcaster. Many humans are skilled in both fighting and ceremonial magic (such as runemakers) but very few are skilled in both fighting and spellcasting. (In some campaigns, ordinary humans cannot be spellcasters at all.) For similar reasons, a pure ceremonialist, such as the occultist, advances in level more quickly than a pure spellcaster such as the Nobiran wizard.

Second, ceremonial magic does not require the caster to expend spell slots. A ceremonialist can perform a ceremony at any time, subject only to the limits of stigma (see below). A 1st level spellcaster can cast a single 1st-level spell just once per day. A 1st level ceremonialist might be able to perform one, two, five, ten, or even more 1st level ceremonies in a day. For this reason, many spellcasters find it valuable to study ceremonial magic in addition to spellcasting.

Other advantages of ceremonial magic include the ability to create and use trinkets and talismans to perform ceremonies (see p. XX); the ability to perform collaborative ceremonies (see p. XX); and the ability to perform ceremonies that are not within the ceremonialist’s repertoire (see p. XX).

However, ceremonial magic carries with it numerous countervailing disadvantages. First, it is slow. Whereas a spellcaster can cast a spell in seconds, a ceremonialist will usually need ten minutes to perform even a low-level ceremony safely, and a powerful ceremony performed very cautiously might take an hour, a day, or even a week.

Second, ceremonial magic can and does fail. Unlike spells, which fail only if the caster’s concentration is disrupted, ceremonies can fail simply due to a minor mistake. Failing a ceremony causes a ceremonialist to acquire a point of stigma. Stigma represents a loss of attunement with the metaphysical, a disorder in the ceremonialist’s soul brought on by the stain of failure. If a ceremonialist accumulates enough stigma, he will lose the ability to perform ceremonies until he purifies himself.

Finally, ceremonial magic is risky. If a ceremonialist is unlucky, attempting to hasten through a ceremony, or performing an unknown ceremony, a botched ceremony can trigger mishaps as grievous as those from arcane experimentation.

### Repertoire

*Books were piled everywhere: ancient volumes bound in serpent-skin, with verdigris-eaten clasps, that held the frightful lore of Atlantis, the pentacles that have power upon the demons of the earth and the moon, the spells that transmute or disintegrate the elements; and runes from a lost language of Hyperborea, which, when uttered aloud, were more deadly than poison or more potent than any philtre.* – The Last Incantation (C. A. Smith)

The ceremonies available to a ceremonialist are called his ceremonial repertoire. A ceremonialist’s ceremonial repertoire functions exactly like an arcane or eldritch caster’s repertoire in all respects save that a ceremonialist records ceremonies into a ceremonial codex instead of spells into a spell book.

Spellcasters and ceremonialists can interpret each other’s magical texts, albeit with difficulty. It takes a ceremonialist one week of study to translate a spell into a ceremony, and a second week of study to add the ceremony to the character’s repertoire. Likewise, it takes a spellcaster one week of study to translate a ceremony into the equivalent spell, and then a second week of study to add the ceremony to the character’s spellbook. Both casters and ceremonialists can use scrolls with one week of study, however.

Likewise, codices are tradition-specific. Ceremonialists from disparate traditions can only use each other’s codices with careful study. It takes a ceremonialist one week of study to translate a ceremony from another tradition into his own, and a second week of study to add the ceremony to his repertoire. If a ceremonialist wants to more easily learn ceremonies from another tradition, he needs to take Ceremonial Magic proficiency to learn that tradition.

#### Ceremonial Spellcasters

Some traditional spellcasters may select the Ceremonial Magic proficiency, which enables them to perform ceremonies as if they were ceremonialists. If a spellcaster is himself a ceremonialist, then his repertoire of spells also serves as his repertoire of ceremonies. He does not have two separate repertoires. Assuming he has room in his repertoire, he can add ceremonies he finds in ceremonial codices directly into his spell books with one week of study (he does not have to spend one week translating the ceremony).

However, spellcasters who accumulate stigma from failing to successfully perform ceremonies may temporarily lose the ability to cast spells until they purify themselves. See the Stigma of Failure, p. XX.


### Ceremonial Traditions

Ceremonialists practice their art within a set of traditions, each representing a school or technique of invoking magical effects. Most ceremonialists learn one tradition and practice it for their entire lives. A ceremonialist may learn additional traditions by selecting one or more additional ranks of the Ceremonial Magic proficiency.

To practice within a tradition means that the ceremonialist can:
*	perform ceremonies using the traditional implements of that tradition;
*	collaborate with other ceremonialists in that tradition;
*	use trinkets and talismans created for use by ceremonialists of that tradition; and
*	create trinkets and talismans within that tradition.

The Ceremonial Tradition table describes several different traditions available to ceremonialists. The Judge may create other traditions for his own campaign setting.

| Tradition |	Description |	Historical Inspirations  |	Classes

#### Traditional Implements

Traditional Implements are the various paraphernalia, fetishes, and accoutrements that a ceremonialist relies upon in his ceremonies. Traditional implements are rated in levels, and a ceremonialist must have implements of a level equal to or exceeding the level of the ceremony he is performing. The cost per level of traditional implements is shown on the table above. Low-level implements are made of common woods, metals, and components, while high-level implements are made of precious metals and exotic materials. Regardless of level, all traditional implements have an encumbrance of 1 stone.

Each type of ceremonial tradition has its own implements; the Traditional Implement table on the following page provides a list of items associated with the implements of various traditions. A ceremonialist cannot use implements of a tradition he does not know.

| Level |	Cost
| :
| 1 |	25gp
| 2 |	100gp
| 3 |	225gp
| 4 |	625gp
| 5 |	1,225gp
| 6 |	2,500gp

### Performing Ceremonies

Performing a ceremony is akin to preparing and cooking something according to a recipe. The ceremonialist must have the implements and ingredients in hand, then diligently perform each step in order. In game terms, this means having the required traditional implements, spending the requisite ceremony time, and then succeeding on a ceremony throw to complete the ceremony.

Once a ceremony is begun, it will require a certain amount of time to complete it, depending on the pace at which the ceremony is performed. There are three paces – regular, hasty, and methodical. A ceremony at regular pace requires one turn (10 minutes) to perform. (Hasty and methodical ceremonies are discussed below.)
 
When the ceremony has been performed, the ceremonialist makes a ceremony throw to complete the ceremony. The base target value for a ceremony throw is 10+, decreased by 1 point per caster level after 1st. The target value of the ceremony throw is increased by 2 points per level of the ceremony above 1st. (The Ceremony Performance table summarizes these target values.) Modify each roll by the Ceremonialist’s WIS modifier. Add +1 to the ceremonialist’s roll if he possesses one or more ranks in Performance (see p. XX). Add +1 or more to the ceremonialist’s roll if he is using a talisman (see p. XX). A natural roll of 1 automatically fails.

**Ceremony Performance by Ceremonialist Level**

|Ceremony Level| 	1|	2|	3|	4|	5|	6|	7|	8|	9|	10|	11|	12|	13|	14
| :
|1st|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+|	4+|	3+|	2+|	1+|	0+|	-1+|	-2+|	-3+
|2nd|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+|	4+|	3+|	2+|	1+|	0+|	-1+
|3rd|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+|	4+|	3+|	2+|	1+
|4th|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+|	4+|	3+
|5th|	18+|	17+|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+|	6+|	5+
|6th|	20+|	19+|	18+|	17+|	16+|	15+|	14+|	13+|	12+|	11+|	10+|	9+|	8+|	7+

If the ceremony throw succeeds, the ceremony is successfully completed and immediately takes effect. If the ceremony throw fails, the ceremony fails and the ceremonialist acquires a point of stigma (see below). If the ceremony throw automatically fails (e.g. due to a roll of natural 1), the ceremony has been botched (see below).

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is a 9th level occultist with WIS 16. He is performing animate dead, a 4th level eldritch ceremony. Completing the ceremony throw will require one turn and a successful ceremony throw. Consulting the Ceremony Performance table, the occultist sees that the ceremony throw has a target value of 8+. Ra-Ramses gains a +2 bonus on the die roll from his WIS modifier, so he effectively needs a 6+. After one turn of incanting, Ra-Ramses rolls his ceremony throw. Unfortunately, he rolls a 2 – a failure! Ra-Ramses gains a point of stigma. Had he rolled a 6 or higher, the ceremony would have been successfully completed, and he’d immediately have been able to animate up to 18 HD worth of undead.  Had he rolled a 1, the ceremony would have been botched.

While performing a ceremony, a ceremonialist may pause for up to one round  each  turn to speak, move  up  to  10’,  drink  a  vial  of  water  or  other  fluid,  adjust  his  implements,  etc. Otherwise  the  ceremonialist  must  remain  stationary  and  concentrate  on  the  ceremony. Should  the  ceremonialist’s  concentration  break  for  more  than  one  round  in  any  turn, the  ceremony is automatically failed. The ceremony is also automatically failed if an opponent successfully deals damage to the ceremonialist, or if the ceremonialist fails a saving throw, prior to completing the ceremony.

A ceremonialist needs to be able to move his hands and speak freely in order to perform a ceremony. In addition, a ceremonialist must have access to traditional implements of sufficient level. Except where otherwise noted, a ceremonialist must have the intended target of the ceremony in visual range throughout the ceremony, whether the target is a specific monster, character, or area of effect. If the ceremonialist loses his ability to move and speak freely, his implements, or his line of sight on the intended target, the ceremony automatically fails.

#### Botched Ceremonies

When a ceremony throw automatically fails (e.g. due to a roll of natural 1 or if the ceremonialist is damaged), the ceremony has been botched. A botched ceremony not only causes the ceremonialist to gain a point of stigma, it damages the ceremonialist’s traditional implements, reducing their effective level by 1. A botched ceremony may also cause a mishap. To find out if a mishap occurs, the ceremonialist must make a mishap throw - another ceremony throw with the same modifiers and target value as the throw he just made. If the mishap throw also results in a failure, then a mishap occurs.

When a mishap occurs, the ceremonialist must roll 1d10 on the Ceremony Mishaps table for his tradition and suffer the effect listed in the column matching the degree of mishap. The degree of the mishap depends on the level of the ceremony that was botched. If the ceremony was 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, a minor mishap occurs. If the ceremony was 4th or 5th level, a major mishap occurs. If the ceremony was 6th level, a catastrophic mishap occurs.

| Ceremony Level |	Degree of Mishap
| :
|1-3 |	Minor
|4-5 |	Major
| 6 |	Catastrophic

EXAMPLE: Let’s return to Ra-Ramses ceremony of animate dead. As before, his ceremony throw has a target value of 6+. This time, however, he fails the throw with a natural roll of 1. His ceremony has been botched! The botch causes Ra-Ramses to gain a point of stigma and damages his traditional implements, reducing them from level 4 to level 3. In addition, Ra-Ramses must make a mishap throw - another ceremony throw with the same modifiers and target value as the throw he just made, e.g. a target value of 6+. Ra-Ramses rolls 1d20 and this time the result is a 3, so Ra-Ramses suffers a mishap. Since animate dead is a 4th level spell, the mishap is major. Ra-Ramses rolls 1d10 on the Chthonic Ceremony Mishaps table. The result of the dice roll is a 3 – his ceremony has revealed unspeakable truths about life and death. The mishap leaves Ra-Ramses insane for four weeks. Who can know what the mad occultist will do….

#### Complex Ceremonies

Certain spells are considerably more complex or onerous to cast than others. Ceremonies replicating such spells are, likewise, more complex and onerous. If a spell takes one turn to cast, the equivalent ceremony takes one hour. If a spell can only be performed once per day, the equivalent ceremony can only be performed once per week. If a spell can only be performed once per week, the equivalent ceremony can only be performed once per month.

EXAMPLE: Summon invisible stalker is a 6th level spell that takes 1 turn to cast and can only be safely cast once per week. Therefore the 6th level ceremony summon invisible stalker takes 1 hour to perform and can only be performed once per month.

#### Methodical Ceremonies

Before a ceremonialist begins a ceremony, he may decide to perform it methodically, in order to increase the chance of success and reduce the risk of mishaps. Depending on the ceremonialist’s tradition, methodically performing a ceremony might entail fasting, prayer, ritual purification, charting the stars, sacrifices to the gods, etc. Regardless of tradition, methodically performing a ceremony requires 6 hours. (Methodically performing a complex ceremony requires one week). During this time, the ceremonialist may  pause for up to one turn  each hour to speak, move  up  to  10’,  drink  a  vial  of  water  or  other  fluid,  adjust  his  implements,  etc. Otherwise  the  ceremonialist  must  remain  stationary  and  concentrate  on  the  ceremony. When methodically performing a ceremony, the ceremonialist gains a +4 bonus on his ceremony throw. If a mishap occurs, the degree of the mishap is reduced by one, from catastrophic to major and major to minor. Minor mishaps are reduced to just the loss of the character’s traditional implements.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses decides to methodically perform a ceremony of animate dead. This will require him to spend 6 hours instead of the usual 10 minutes, but will afford him a +4 bonus on the ceremony throw. Consulting the Ceremony Performance table, the occultist sees that the ceremony throw has a target value of 8+. Ra-Ramses gains a +2 bonus on the die roll from his WIS modifier and a +4 bonus from his methodical preparations, so he effectively needs a 2+. After spending six hours performing the ceremony, Ra-Ramses rolls a 3 – a success! Ra-Ramses has successfully completed the ceremony of animate dead. Had Ra-Ramses not made methodical preparations, his ceremony would have been a failure and he would have gained a point of stigma.

What if Ra-Ramses had rolled a natural 1 instead of a 3? A natural 1 would have been a botch, and Ra-Ramses would have rolled 1d20 again to see if it led to a mishap. But because his target value on the original ceremony throw was reduced from 6+ to 2+, his chances of a mishap occurring are reduced from 25% (1-5) to 5% (1). If he did suffer a mishap, it would be a minor one instead of a major one.

#### Hasty Ceremonies

Before a ceremonialist begins a ceremony, he may decide to perform it hastily. If the ceremonialist is in combat, the intention to perform a hasty ceremony must be announced before initiative is rolled (as with spellcasting). A hasty ceremony is performed in one round, as if casting a spell, rather than in one turn. (A complex hasty ceremony is performed in one turn.) However, the caster suffers a -4 penalty on his ceremony throw, and the range of failure is increased by 2, e.g. a natural roll of 1-3 automatically fails.  

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is annoyed with a merchant’s bargaining tactics. He hastily performs a ceremony of choking grip, a 1st level ceremony. Completing the ceremony will require one round and a successful ceremony throws. Consulting the Ceremony Performance table, the occultist sees that the ceremony throw has a target value of 2+. Ra-Ramses gains a +2 bonus on the die roll from his WIS modifier, but a -4 penalty from haste, so he effectively needs a 4+. His range of automatic failure is increased to 1-3 so any failure will be a botch! Ra-Ramses rolls a 5 and succeeds. “I’m altering the deal,” he says to the choking merchant. “Pray I don’t—“ but the merchant has already died.

Collaborative ceremonies (see below) cannot be performed hastily. Ceremonies cannot be performed both hastily and methodically at the same time, and ceremonialists who try automatically suffer a catastrophic mishap for being annoying.


|Ceremony Pace|	Time Required|	Throw Modifier|	Automatic Failure|	Degree of Mishap
| :
|Hasty|	1 round (10 seconds)|	-4|	1-3|	By ceremony level
|Regular|	1 turn (10 minutes)|	0|	1|	By ceremony level
|Methodical|	36 turns (6 hours)|	+4|	1|	By ceremony level, reduced by 1
|Complex Regular|	6 turns (1 hour)|	0|	1|	By ceremony level
|Complex Methodical|	1 week (7 days)|	+4|	1|	By ceremony level, reduced by 1

#### Collaborative Ceremonies

A ceremonialist may be joined in the performance of a ceremony by one or more assistants. Assistants must either know the ceremony being performed or must belong to the same ceremonial tradition as the lead ceremonialist they are assisting. The maximum number of ceremonialists that can assist in the performance of a ceremony is equal to the level of the ceremony.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses, a 9th level occultist, is performing animate dead, a 4th level eldritch ceremony. Ra-Ramses’s potential collaborators include Ashanti (a 9th level witch of the chthonic tradition), Thoth-Horus (a 7th level loremaster of the theurgical tradition), and Bolgor (a 5th level shaman of the runic tradition). Of the three, only Thoth-Horus knows animate dead. Ashanti can assist because she is of the same tradition as Ra-Ramses. Thoth-Horus can assist because he knows the ceremony being performed. Bolgor cannot assist because he does not know the ceremony being performed and does not belong to the same tradition as Ra-Ramses.

After the ceremony has been performed, but before the lead ceremonialist makes his ceremony throw, each assistant makes a ceremony throw. Calculate the target value and modifiers for the ceremony throw for each assistant separately as if the assistant were performing the ceremony himself. If the assistant’s ceremony throw succeeds, he increases the lead ceremonialist’s effective caster level by 1 for purposes of performing the ceremony and calculating the ceremony’s effects. If the assistant’s ceremony throw fails, it has no effect. If the assistant’s ceremony throw fails with a natural 1, it reduces the lead ceremonialist’s effective caster level by 1. (It does not count as a botch or trigger a mishap throw, however; only the lead ceremonialist can botch and trigger a mishap).

Once all of the assistants have made their ceremony throws, the lead ceremonialist makes his ceremony throw using his modified caster level. If the ceremony is successfully completed, the ceremony’s effects are calculated based on the ceremonialist’s modified caster level. If the ceremony is failed, all of the participating ceremonialists gain one point of stigma. If the ceremony is botched, all of the participating ceremonialists gain one point of stigma, but only the lead ceremonialist has his implements damaged. However, any mishap that occurs affects not just the lead ceremonialist but all the assistants as well.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses performs the ceremony of animate dead with Ashanti and Thoth-Horus assisting. According to the Ceremony Performance table, Ashanti’s target value is 8+ while Thoth-Horus’s target value is 10+. However, Thoth-Horus has a WIS of 18, so his target value is reduced to 7+.  Ashanti fails her ceremony throw with a roll of 5, while Thoth-Horus succeeds on his with a roll of 11. Ra-Ramses now makes his own ceremony throw. Because one assistant succeeded, Ra-Ramses’ caster level is increased by one from 9th to 10th level. This reduces his target value by 1, from a modified 6+ to 5+. His die roll is a 12, so he easily succeeds. Ra-Ramses can  now animate 20 HD of undead instead of 18 HD, since his effective level is 10th rather than 9th.

If the ceremonialist is performing the ceremony methodically, all of the assistants must do so as well.

#### Unknown Ceremonies

A ceremonialist may perform a ceremony that is not in his repertoire (an unknown ceremony) if he has access to a ceremonial codex containing that ceremony. Performing an unknown ceremony is dangerous, however. The ceremonialist suffers a -4 penalty to the ceremony throw, and if the ceremony is not successful for any reason, then the ceremony is botched and the ceremonialist suffers a mishap!  

An unknown ceremony can be performed methodically and collaboratively. An unknown ceremony can be performed hastily, if desired - but only fools would dare it.

EXAMPLE: During an adventure, Ra-Ramses discovered a ceremonial codex containing the 6th-level ceremony enslave. Ramses-Ra does not know enslave and won’t be able to add it to his repertoire until he gains another two levels of experience. <br> 
Unfortunately, Ra-Ramses recently went insane due to a mishap while performing an animate dead ceremony. The mad occultist has become obsessed with an unrequited lust for a nubile young princess, and decides to perform this unknown ritual on her. After kidnapping the princess, binding her in a lewd state to a large stone slab lit with flickering torches, and ensuring there are no nearby barbarians to interrupt his efforts, the insane Ra-Ramses begins the terrible ceremony. As a 9th level ceremonialist attempting a 6th level ceremony, Ra-Ramses has a target value of 12+ on his ceremony throw. Ra-Ramses has WIS 16, so he will gain a +2 bonus to each throw, but the fact that ceremony is unknown imposes a -4 penalty. His final target value will be 14+.<br>
Unfortunately for the lusty occultist, his roll is a 11, a failure. Since he is performing an unknown ritual, this automatically results in a mishap. Since the ceremony is 6th level, the mishap is catastrophic. Ra-Ramses rolls 1d10 on the Chthonic Ceremony Mishaps table. The result of the dice roll is a 5 – the mishap leaves Ra-Ramses massively warped. He must roll 1d10+10 on the magical mutations sub-table. The result of this die roll is a 19, meaning Ra-Ramses’s body degenerates into a rotting piece of meat, with maggots crawling from his orifices and flies buzzing around his flesh. The nubile princess screams in horror at the monstrous being before her.  The hideously disfigured Ra-Ramses  knows his only hope to satiate his evil lust is to try again… Oh, the insanity.<br>
Had Ra-Ramses performed the unknown ceremony methodically, of course, his target value would have been reduced to 10+ and his throw a success!

**The Ashley J. Williams Memorial Rule (optional):** From time to time, non-ceremonialists of dubious common sense come across a ceremonial codex, and make an attempt to perform a ceremony within - perhaps intentionally, perhaps without even knowing they are doing so. As such characters are not ceremonialists, all ceremonies are unknown to them. A non-ceremonialist attempting to perform an unknown ceremony does so as a 1st level ceremonialist with an additional -4 penalty (on top of the penalty for unknown ceremonies and/or hasty ceremonies). Any failure is treated as a catastrophic mishap. Note that if a character has even one rank of Ceremonial Magic proficiency, this rule will not apply to him.

EXAMPLE: Ashley, known to his friends as Ash, is on a trip with friends. While searching a cabin they are visiting, Ash finds a book bound in human skin. The book is actually a ceremonial codex of the Chthonic tradition containing a 6th level summoning ceremony. Ash reads the book out loud, accidentally performing a hasty unknown ceremony. The ceremony throw fails (as a throw of 32+ is wont to do). Since the throw fails, it triggers a catastrophic mishap. Ash rolls 1d10 on the Chthonic Ceremony  Mishap table.  The result of the die roll is a 1, meaning 1d8 spectres, spirits of the evil dead, appear and attack the campers. The small cabin also becomes forsaken.


### The Stigma of Failure

When a spellcaster casts a spell, he spends a portion of his personal power to draw on and manipulate the spell’s power, which is channeled from either the gods or from ambient elemental sources. (A surplus or deficit of such ambient power is why some spells are cast at higher or lower levels in, e.g. sinkholes of evil or furnaces of elemental fire.) When a spellcaster’s internal reserves are exhausted, he is no longer able to manipulate these power sources, and cannot cast any further spells.

When a ceremonialist performs a ceremony, however, he does not spend any portion of his personal power. (Indeed, most ceremonialists lack the ability to tap their personal power at all – that’s why they are ceremonialists and not spellcasters!) The advantage of this is that a ceremonialist can perform ceremonies as frequently as desired, without need to regulate his own internal reserves. The disadvantage of this is that it is much harder for a ceremonialist to channel power from the gods or elements. Absolute concentration from a state of metaphysical equilibrium is required. When a ceremonialist fails to successfully perform a ceremony, this fragile metaphysical equilibrium is disrupted by the stigma of his failure.

Stigma is measured in points. A ceremonialist gains one point of stigma each time he fails a ceremony performance throw. The amount of stigma a ceremonialist can withstand is known as his stigma threshold and is equal to the highest level of ceremony he knows (e.g. if a ceremonialist has a repertoire of two 1st level ceremonies, his stigma threshold is 1. If he has a repertoire of two 1st level ceremonies, two 2nd level ceremonies, and one 3rd level ceremony, his stigma threshold is 3.) When a ceremonialist’s stigma equals or exceeds his stigma threshold, he loses the ability to perform ceremonies until he purifies himself of the stigma. (A ceremonial spellcaster also lose the ability to cast spells until he purifies himself of the stigma.)

Ceremonialists can, however, still make use of trinkets while under the stigma of failure.

#### Purification of Stigma

A ceremonialist can purify himself of all accumulated stigma by resting for 8 hours and then spending 1 hour (6 turns) engaged in various cleansing rites with his traditional implements. The specific rites will depend on the ceremonialist’s tradition and the Judge’s setting, but might include prayer, meditation, anointing with oils, inhaling incenses, and other activities. At the conclusion of the cleansing rites, the ceremonialist reduces his accumulated stigma to 0.

As a side effect of purification, all of a ceremonialist’s trinkets (see p. XX) are destroyed or emptied – the ceremonialist has cleansed himself of all his past metaphysical connections, both good and bad.  

EXAMPLE: Balbus is a 3rd level ecclesiastic with WIS 16, one rank of Performance (chanting), and a repertoire including cure light wounds, counterspell, and cure moderate wounds. As the highest level spell in his repertoire is 2nd level, he has a stigma threshold of 2. He begins an adventure with no stigma. During an encounter with an orc witch-doctor, he performs a hasty ceremony of counterspell. The target value is 8+, reduced by 3 (from WIS and Performance) but increased by 4 (because the ceremony is hasty) for a total target value of 9+. He rolls a 5, so the ceremony fails and he gains a point of stigma. After the fight, he performs a regular ceremony of cure light wounds. The target value is 8+, reduced by 3 to 5+. He rolls a 17, and successfully performs the ceremony. Later in the day, Balbus and his henchmen Algernon are both badly wounded. He performs a regular ceremony of cure moderate wounds. The target value is 10+, reduced by 3 to 7+. He rolls an 18, and successfully performs the ceremony. He then attempts a regular ceremony of cure moderate wounds on Algernon, again at 7+. He rolls a 7, and succeeds – barely. Later, he encounters a mysterious illusion. He performs a regular ceremony of counterspell, against a target value of 5+. Unfortunately he rolls a 4, so the ceremony fails and he gains another point of stigma. Balbus’s accumulate stigma now equals his stigma threshold, so he loses the ability to successfully perform ceremonies until he purifies himself. He and Algernon make camp for the night, and after a good night’s rest of 8 hours, Balbus spends 1 hour praying to Ammonar. His stigma is reduced to 0.


### Cermonial Magic Research

Ceremonialists are capable of performing magic research as spellcasters of their magic type. Thus eldritch ceremonialists who reach 5th level may begin to independently research ceremonies, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level, they may create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, eldritch ceremonialists may learn and cast 7th, 8th, and 9th level ritual spells, crossbreed monsters, and craft magical constructs. If chaotic, eldritch ceremonialists may create necromantic servants and even become undead themselves.

In addition, ceremonialists may create special types of magic items that are exclusive to ceremonialists. Ceremonialists of any level may create ceremonial trinkets and ceremonialists of 5th level or above may create ceremonial talismans.

### Ceremonial Trinkets

To create a trinket, a ceremonialist must first secure an object sufficiently valuable to store the desired ceremony. The value of the object must equal or exceed the base cost shown for the desired ceremony level and trinket type on the adjoining Trinket Cost table. Objects commonly used as disposable trinkets include various sorts of emollients, herbs, ointments, powders, and unguents. Objects commonly used as rechargeable trinkets include baubles, beads, bones, phylacteries, skulls, stones, teeth, and tiny figurines, as well as various objects found in traditional implements.

|Level|	Disposable Trinket|	Rechargeable Trinket
| :
|1|	5gp|	50gp
|2|	10gp|	100gp
|3|	15gp|	150gp
|4|	25gp|	225gp
|5|	35gp|	300gp
|6|	50gp|	400gp

The ceremonialist must then acquire special components with a gp value equal to the trinket’s base cost.  Each ceremony requires a unique set of special components. The Judge will determine the specific components required for each ceremony depending on its tradition. The same ceremony might use different components when performed by ceremonialists of different traditions. The ceremonialist learns the special components required by his tradition for the ceremony when he adds the ceremony to his repertoire. If the appropriate special components are not available, miscellaneous special components can be substituted instead, but doing so will impose a penalty of -1 per level of the ceremony.  

**Note:** The Monster Parts section of Lairs & Encounters provides guidelines on identifying, harvesting, and valuing special components, along with detailed lists suggesting which spells each monster part in the game the component might be associated with.

Finally, the ceremonialist must store the ceremony in the trinket. Storing a ceremony can be performed hastily, regularly, or methodically, collaboratively or individually, as desired. A special -4 penalty applies to the throw due to the added complexity of storing the spell in a trinket. If the ceremony is performed successfully, the trinket is ready for use. If the ceremony fails, the ceremonialist acquires a point of stigma. If the ceremony is botched, the object and the special components are both destroyed. The special components are otherwise only consumed if the ceremony succeeds.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is a 9th level occultist with WIS 16. He decides to make a chthonic trinket containing the 4th level ceremony fear. He must first secure an object to store the ceremony. Since fear is a 4th level ceremony, the object must be worth 25gp or more. Ra-Ramses purchases a silver dagger worth 25gp as the object. Next, Ra-Ramses must expends 25gp worth of appropriate special components. The Judge rules that fear requires 25gp worth of mummy wrappings, which Ra-Ramses fortunately has in ample supply due to his many forays into tombs and crypts. Finally, Ra-Ramses must perform the ceremony of fear to store it into the trinket. As he is not pressed for time, he performs the ceremony methodically. His base target value to perform a 4th level ceremony is 8+, modified to 12+ because he is storing a ceremony in a trinket. He gains a +2 bonus from his WIS bonus and another +4 bonus because he is performing the ceremony methodically. Therefore, he will succeed on a 6+. He rolls an 11 and easily succeeds. The mummy wrappings are consumed, and Ra-Ramses now has a 4th level chthonic dagger of fear.

Storing Special Components: When not being used to create trinkets (or other magic items), special components should be stored carefully in alchemical jars known as metamphora. Special components are fragile, as the residual energies are prone to dissolving if not stored properly. There is a 5% cumulative chance each day of an improperly-stored special component losing all its value.  

Metamphora: Designed to store special components, metamphora are ceramic jars inscribed with alchemical sigils and stoppered with copper seals. Metamphora come in an array of different sizes and shapes, as more valuable special components require sturdier, stronger metamphora to prevent leakage. Metamphora cost 5gp and weigh 1 stone for every 60gp of value they store.

Substitute Special Components: Finding the right special components can be a challenging and time-consuming endeavor. Eldritch power is, however, fungible on a metaphysical level. This fungibility allows a ceremonialist to substitute alternative special components of the same total gp value for the unique special components required for any given ceremony. Since it is more challenging to tap the energies for the ceremony in this case, the ceremonialist suffers a -1 penalty per level of the ceremony on his Ceremony Throw when using substitute special components. Merchants such as curios dealers, herbalists, and antiquarians will sell nonspecific special components (such as spider webs, plant roots, crushed ivory, and so on) for 1gp each, in various markets, subject to the usual limits of equipment availability and commission.

#### Using Trinkets

A ceremonialist carrying a trinket he created can use it to perform the ceremony it contains as if it were a spell that he was casting. Since most spells require just one round to cast, most ceremonies can be performed in one round when using a trinket, but if a spell takes one turn to cast, the equivalent ceremony performed with a trinket takes one turn to perform. In any case, the ceremonialist does not have to use his traditional implements, make a ceremony throw, or risk stigma when using a trinket. The trinket is either emptied or destroyed when used, depending on its type.

If in combat, a PC must announce the intention to perform a ceremony using a trinket prior to initiative being determined at the beginning of a round. Should an opponent successfully deal damage to the character or if the character is required to roll a saving throw and fails prior to using the trinket to perform the ceremony, the ceremony fails and the trinket is destroyed.
 
EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is being pursued by well-armed cultists displeased by his theft of an important ceremonial codex. Prior to initiative being determined for the round, he declares his intention to perform fear using his trinket. Ra-Ramses wins the initiative, and the ceremony is completed, as if he were casting a spell – no ceremony throw required. A  60’ long and 30’ wide cone of fear stretches from Ra-Ramses’ hands, and all within the cone must save versus Spells or flee from the him for 30 rounds. The trinket is destroyed by its use. Had Ra-Ramses suffered damage or failed a saving throw prior to using the trinket to perform the ceremony, the trinket would have been destroyed but no effects would have occurred.

A ceremonialist cannot use a trinket created by another character. However, other ceremonialists’ trinkets can be harvested for their value as special components, or possibly recharged, as described below.

#### Emptying and Destroying Trinkets

A disposable trinket is automatically destroyed when used or when the ceremonialist purifies himself of stigma. A rechargeable trinket is automatically emptied when used or when the ceremonialist purifies himself of stigma. However, an emptied rechargeable trinket can be recharged simply by performing the trinket’s ceremony on it. The ceremonialist does not have to pay the special component cost when recharging an emptied trinket.

In combat, a character may automatically destroy a trinket he is holding with an action in lieu of attacking, and destroy a trinket in another’s hands with a sunder. Trinkets save at -4 versus sundering.

#### Buying and Selling Trinkets

Trinkets are not typically bought or sold in the market as they are personal to the ceremonialist who created them. However, at the Judge’s discretion, rechargeable trinkets might be bought and sold in markets at twice their base cost, while particular special components from local monsters might be available.

#### Identifying Trinkets

Trinkets detect as magical. A ceremonialist will recognize that an object is a trinket of his own tradition automatically with 1 turn of inspection. On a proficiency throw of 11+ he will be able to identify the ceremony stored in the trinket. A ceremonialist will recognize that an object is a trinket of a foreign tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+. With a 14+ he will be able to ascertain which tradition it is affiliated with and whether it is disposable or rechargeable. With an 18+ he can identify the ceremony stored in the trinket. Ceremonialists with multiple ranks in Ceremonial Magic will have better target values (see p. XX).

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses discovers an alabaster statuette of an eagle carved with liturgical scripts in Classical Auran. He inspects the statuette and makes a proficiency throw, rolling a 15. The Judge informs him that the statuette is a rechargeable trinket of the theurgical tradition. Had his throw result been 18 or more, Ramses-Ra could have learned that the statuette was a rechargeable theurgical trinket of phoenix aura.

When a trinket is crafted using a proficiency from the knowledge category (see Proficiencies Aiding Ceremonial Magic on p. XX), this can provide clues to its nature to those who know the relevant proficiency. A character may apply his own ranks in the proficiency as a bonus to the throw to identify the trinket. If the character is otherwise ignorant of ceremonial magic, he can recognize that the object is some sort of trinket with a proficiency throw of 11+.  

EXAMPLE: A cutpurse steals the 4th level trinket from Ra-Ramses. The cutpurse was at one time an altar boy and possesses Theology proficiency. The trinket was crafted with Theology, so the cutpurse will be able to recognize it as a trinket with a Theology proficiency throw of 11+.   

#### Salvaging Found Trinkets

If a ceremonialist finds a trinket of any type and successfully identifies the ceremony it contains, he can use the trinket as a special component worth its base value for purposes of creating a new trinket that contains the same ceremony.

EXAMPLE: If Ra-Ramses knew the phoenix aura ceremony and had a suitable object available to contain it, he could use the theurgical statuette he found as a special component worth 300gp towards the creation of a chthonic trinket of phoenix aura.

If a ceremonialist finds and identifies rechargeable trinket of his own tradition containing a ceremony in his repertoire, he can recharge it as if it were an empty trinket of his own make.

EXAMPLE: IF Ra-Ramses were a theurgical ceremonialist with phoenix aura in his repertoire, he could perform that ceremony to recharge the eagle statuette and thereafter make use of the trinket as if it were of his own make.


### Ceremonial Talisman

*Sharajasha lifted one arm to brush aside the brushes, and the young barbarian saw that his long fingers bore many sigils and talismanic rings of power. One was a hoop of iron, embossed with a curious glyph. Another was carved of red jade, engraved with wedge-shaped runes in some unknown tongue. Other rings flashed upon his long, sensitive hands… Each ring was fashioned from a different substance: crystal, metal, stone, or wood. With the power locked in these talismanic rings, Thongor grimly surmised, the wizard could invoke and command spirits and elemental forces.* – Thongor and the Wizard of Lemuria (Lin Carter)

A ceremonial talisman is a magic item that provides a bonus to ceremony throws made to perform particular types of ceremonies. A ceremonial talisman is described with four characteristics: its object, its tradition, its bonus, and its type. Talisman bonuses can range from +1 to +4. Talisman types include: death & necromancy; detection; elemental air; elemental earth; elemental fire; elemental water; enchantment & illusion; healing; movement; protection; summoning; and transmogrification. A talisman can aid just one type of ceremonies, or several types.

Ceremonial talismans are usually relatively small objects (counting as 1 item for encumbrance purposes), although larger objects can be used if desired. Objects commonly used as talismans include various sorts of amulets, baubles, beads, bracelets, curios, gems, pendants, phylacteries, rings, rosaries, skulls, staves, and stones.

#### Making Talismans

 In order to create a talisman, the ceremonialist must know at least one ceremony of the type that the talisman will aid, or must obtain a formula or sample of such a talisman. The base cost and time required to create a talisman depends on its bonus and the number of types of ceremonies it aids, as shown on the Talisman Creation table.

The ceremonialist must have access to his traditional implements while making the trinket. The ceremonialist must also have special components with a gp value equal to the talisman’s base cost. The special components are consumed in the process. As with trinkets and other magic items, the Judge will determine the specific components required for the talisman depending on its tradition and it type. If the appropriate special components are not available, miscellaneous special components can be substituted instead, but doing so will impose a penalty of -1 per bonus point.

A successful magic research throw is required to complete the talisman. The target value for this throw is increased by the bonus of the talisman multiplied by the number of types of ceremonies it aids. All of the usual bonuses and penalties applicable to magic item creation (Intelligence, Magical Engineering proficiency, precious materials, workshops, formulas/samples, assistants etc.) apply.

If the throw fails, the ceremonialist has failed to create the talisman. The time and components are wasted. A roll of 1-3 always fails. If the throw succeeds, the ceremonialist has succeeded in creating the talisman.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is a 9th level occultist with INT 16 and WIS 16.. He decides to make a +2 chthonic talisman of death & necromancy and enchantment. It will take 2 months per type, or 4 months total. It will cost 10,000 per type, or 20,000gp total. The talisman will also require 20,000gp in special components. The Judge and Ra-Ramses agree that the talisman will take the form of a large ebony skull with sigils inlaid in silver. At the end of the time period, Ra-Ramses makes a magic research throw. As a 9th level Occultist, his target value is 8+, modified by his Intelligence bonus of +2 to 6+. However, his target value is penalized by the talisman’s bonus of +2 multiplied by the number of types of ceremonies it aids (2), or +4, for a total of 10+. He rolls a 14 and succeeds.


|Bonus|	Base Cost|	Time
| :
|+1|	5,000gp per type| 	1 month per type
|+2|	10,000gp per type|	2 months per type
|+3|	15,000gp per type|	3 months per type
|+4|	20,000gp per type|	4 months per type

#### Using Talismans

A ceremonialist carrying a talisman applies its bonus to the ceremony throws of any ceremonies of that type. In addition, a ceremonialist does not have to use his traditional implements to perform a ceremony when using a talisman that aids ceremonies of that type. A character can carry and use multiple talismans, but only one talisman’s bonus can be applied to any particular ceremony throw.

The lead ceremonialist in a collaborative ceremony can use a talisman, but assistants cannot use one. A ceremonialist cannot use a talisman when performing an unknown ceremony. A ceremonialist can use a talisman created by another ceremonialist, but only of his tradition and only for ceremonies in his repertoire.  

#### Destroying Talismans

In combat, a character may destroy a talisman he is holding with an action in lieu of attacking, and destroy a talisman in another’s hands with a sunder.  

#### Identifying Talismans

Like trinkets, talismans radiate magic and can be recognized and identified with appropriate proficiencies.

#### Buying and Selling Talismans

With the Judge’s permission, talismans may be bought in markets for twice their base cost, and sold for their base cost. We strongly recommend that the Judge strictly enforce Equipment Availability by Market Class for talismans, and only permit talismans of traditions which are common in the culture to be available.


### Corruption from Ceremonial Magic

Eldritch ceremonialists acquire corruption points whenever they learn or perform a black magic ceremony, or perform grey magic ceremonies for corrupt purposes in the same manner that eldritch spellcasters acquire them for learning and casting spells. The following additional rules apply:

*	A ceremonialist assisting in a black magic ceremony gains 1 point of corruption, regardless of the level of the ceremony.
*	A ceremonialist creating a black magic trinket may gain 1 point of corruption. Roll 1d10. If the result of the roll is equal to or lower than the level of trinket’s affiliated ceremony, 1 point of corruption is gained.
*	A ceremonialist creating a black magic talisman gains 1 point of corruption per level of the ceremony or ceremonies affiliated with the talisman.

### Trinkets, Talismans, and Scrolls
Trinkets, talismans, and scrolls are similar enough that some players and Judges may find it easy to confuse the three. As a summary:

*	Scrolls allow a character to cast a particular spell that they might or might not know without expending any spell slots.
*	Trinkets allow a character to perform a particular ceremony they already know as if it were a spell.
*	Talismans increases the chances of a character performing a particular ceremony or ceremonies.

#### Proficiencies Aiding Ceremonial Magic

Performing ceremonies and creating talismans and trinkets are complex processes. Depending on his tradition, the ceremonialist may need to predict the movement of the stars, carve and shape runes, perform intricate dances, or other esoteric practices. Ceremonialists can benefit from various general proficiencies that assist in these practices.

For purposes of ceremonial magic, proficiencies are divided into three categories: crafting, knowledge, and performance. The Useful Proficiencies by Category table, below, lists which proficiencies aid ceremonial magic. Crafting proficiencies help the ceremonialist manufacture well-made talismans and trinkets. Knowledge proficiencies guide the ceremonialist in choosing the best invocations to create trinkets and talismans given the time, day, correspondences, and other factors. Performance proficiencies aid the ceremonialist in making ceremony throws.


|Category|	Useful Proficiencies
| :
|Crafting|	Alchemy, Art (illumination, mosaic, painting, sculpting) Craft (armor-making, bookbinding, brewing, calligraphy, carpentry, doll-making, leatherwork, jewelling, rune-carving, stonemasonry, tinkering, weaving, weapon-smithing)
|Knowledge|	Collegiate Wizardry, Knowledge (astrology, history, metaphysics, natural philosophy, occult), Naturalism, Theology
|Performance|	Performance (chanting, dancing, epic poetry, playing instruments, singing, storytelling)

A ceremonialist may add his ranks in one proficiency in the Crafting category and one proficiency in the Knowledge category to his magic research throws when creating trinkets and talismans. He may add +1 to his ceremony throws when performing ceremonies if he has at least one rank in the Performance category.

EXAMPLE #1: Ramses-Ra has the following proficiencies: Alchemy 3, Knowledge (occult) 2, and Performance (chanting). When creating trinkets and talismans, he gains a +3 bonus from the crafting category for his ranks in Alchemy and a +2 bonus from the knowledge category for his ranks in Knowledge (occult). This gives him a total +5 bonus to his magic research throws when creating trinkets and talismans. When performing ceremonies, he gains a +1 bonus to ceremony throws from the performance category for his rank in Performance (chanting).

When proficiencies are used in the creation of trinkets and talismans, their appearance and composition will in some manner reflect the proficiencies used. The crafting proficiencies used will be reflected in their form and substance. For instance, if Alchemy proficiency were used to create a trinket, it might be a potion, powder, or balm; if Art (sculpting) were used, it might be a tiny bronze idol; if Craft (calligraphy) were used it might be a finely-inked scroll. The knowledge proficiencies used will be reflected in the trinket or talisman’s iconography and liturgy. For instance, if Knowledge (occult) were used to create a trinket, it might bear chaotic symbols, while if Collegiate Wizardry were used it might bear glyphs of power.

EXAMPLE: Lucius has the following proficiencies: Art (illumination), Craft (jewelling) 2, Knowledge (astrology), Theology, Performance (chanting), and Performance (singing). He creates a trinket using Art (illumination) and Knowledge (astrology), gaining a +2 bonus to his magic research throw. His trinket is a scroll illuminated with an astrological chart in red and gold ink. Later, he creates a talisman using Craft (jewelling) and Theology, gaining a +3 bonus to his magic research throw. His talisman is a crystal carved with a symbol of the Empyrean gods on each of its facets.

When a proficiency from the knowledge category is used to create a trinket or talisman, characters who possess that proficiency will gain a bonus to recognize and identify the trinket or talisman. See Identifying Trinkets (p. xx) for more details.

**Craftsmanship of the Ancients Memorial Rule (optional):** A character may add his ranks in one proficiency in the Crafting category and one proficiency in the Knowledge category to all his magic research throws when performing magic research. The Judge should determine which proficiencies apply depending on the nature of the research.

## Eldritch Spell Lists

### Designation of Spell Types

In the spell lists below, the following superscripts are used to designate particular types of spells. This can be helpful to the Judge in determining which spells are affected by various proficiencies and class powers such as Elementalism, Transmogrification, and so on. If the Judge introduces new spells or new powers that affect different types of spells, the Judge can use the Spell Power Guidelines in this chapter to categorize such innovations.

| | | | | | |
| :
|<sup>dth</sup> | 	death |	<sup>ill</sup> | 	illusion |	<sup>trn</sup> | 	transmogrification
| <sup>elm()</sup> | 	elemental (type) | <sup>nec</sup>| 	necromancy |	<sup>#</sup> |	spell modified from earlier version
| enc | 	enchantment |	<sup>pro</sup> | 	protection |	* | 	reversible spell

Spells detailed in the ACKS core rules are noted in regular font; spells detailed in the Player’s Companion are noted by being italicized; and spells detailed in this supplement are noted by being bolded. Reversible spells are listed separately if they sit on different lists. Some of the new spells are unique to eldritch casters. Others are similar to existing arcane or divine spells, but with modified effects that take into account the limits of eldritch magic (typically by requiring an elemental source). Finally, some spells (noted with #) are pre-existing arcane and divine spells that are presented here with updated effects, either to reflect new rules introduced in this supplement (such as base healing rate or corruption) or simply for clarity from insights gained in actual play that has occurred since the spell first appeared. For instance, we have clarified how choking grip works in the combat round structure. The new mechanics of these spells should apply to any spellcaster who uses them, not just eldritch spellcasters.

### New and Updated Spells

#### Angelic Aura

| Range:    | self
| :-------- | :------------
| Eldritch    | 5 (white)
| Duration: | 1 round per level

This spell creates a glowing aura of empyrean power around the caster in a 15’ radius. When the spell is cast, and on the caster’s initiative each round thereafter for the duration of the spell, the angelic aura can damage undead creatures within its area of effect. Up to one undead creature can be affected per caster level. Undead creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Each affected undead creature must make a saving throw versus Death. On a successful save, the undead creature avoids the effect that round. On a failed save, the undead creature suffers 5d8 points of damage. The effects of an angelic aura continue until dispelled or the duration elapses. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effects.

#### Auditory Illusion		

| Range:    | 60’
| :-------- | :---
| Eldritch  | 1 (Grey)
| Duration: | 1 turn
This spell creates a false sound. The sound can be centered anywhere within range, and within that range the sound can fluctuate and move, imitating approaching or receding footsteps, laughter, voices, and other possibilities. The sound produced can be as loud as the noise produced by thirty man-sized creatures. The auditory illusion does not have to be human-like, but could be animal or monster sounds. The Judge should determine how much sound and how many individuals it might represent. For instance, the sounds of thirty humans might be approximately that of sixty children, or eight ogres. Creatures who hear the sound are allowed a saving throw versus Spells to realize that the effect is illusory, but only if they actively attempt to disbelieve.

#### Arrows of the Sun

| Range:    | 120’
| :
| Eldritch  | 6 (Grey)
| Duration: | 1 round
This spell sets aflame the nocked arrows of friendly archers within range. Up to 20 arrows of the sun can be created per caster level.  An arrow of the sun deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful attack. If an arrow of the sun is not immediately shot, its flame extinguishes at the end of the round, returning the arrow to an ordinary weapon.

This spell was created for battlefield use. In Domains at War: Battles, it can affect a friendly bow-equipped unit within six hexes of the caster’s hex.  That unit deals an extra point of damage on each successful bow attack throw during its next attack sequence.

#### Atonement
| Range:    |	0’
| :
| Eldritch  | 6 (White)
| Duration: |	permanent
This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. If the subject has suffered an involuntary alignment change due to magic, atonement will immediately restore the character’s original alignment. If the subject has suffered an alignment change due to accumulated corruption, atonement requires a period of spiritual purity, during which the subject must avoid any Chaotic actions and any further corruption. If the subject remains spiritually pure for a number of weeks equal to his number of accumulated corruption points, the atonement reduces his accumulated corruption by his Wisdom score and either restores his original alignment or removes one corrupting weakness. A subject can make another atonement to continue to reduce his corruption only after gaining a level of experience without acquiring any further corruption. Atonement is a complex spell requiring 1 turn to cast.

#### Avian Messenger

| Range:  |	special
| :
| Eldritch  | 3 (White)
| Duration: |	12 hours
This spell allows the caster to relay a message to a designated recipient by means of an avian messenger. The messenger will be a small winged creature capable of long-distance flight. The spell will conscript the nearest suitable creature to serve as the avian messenger so it might be, e.g., a pigeon, a raven, a bat, or even a dragonfly, depending on what is nearby when the spell is cast. As soon as the spell is cast, the avian messenger will begin traveling to the caster, typically arriving within 2d6 rounds. If the avian messenger is somehow prevented from reaching the caster (e.g. if he is imprisoned deep underground), it will circle in the vicinity until it is able to reach him or until the spell expires.

Once the avian messenger reaches the caster, it will wait up to 10 minutes (one turn) for the caster to whisper his desired message into its ear. If the caster fails to whisper a message into the messenger’s ear within 10 minutes, the spell ends and the creature flies off.  The avian messenger can understand any language(s) the caster speaks, and remember a message up to 10 seconds (one round) long per level of the caster.

Once the caster has finished whispering his message, he must designate a recipient for the message. The caster must know the proper name or identifying title of the recipient and the location of his residence (either firsthand, from scrying, or from a map). Once the recipient has been designated, the avian messenger will begin traveling to the recipient’s residence. The avian messenger will travel for up to 12 hours at a rate of 48 miles per hour in order to reach the recipient’s residence. If the recipient is present when the messenger arrives, it will whisper the message into his ear in whatever language the caster spoke. If the recipient is absent, or somehow inaccessible (e.g. in a windowless room), the avian messenger will circle in the vicinity until it is able to reach him or until the spell expires.

#### Bane-rune

| Range:    | touch
| :
| Eldritch  | 1 (White)
| Duration: | 1 turn
By magically inscribing a baleful glyph onto the striking head of a weapon, this spell temporarily enhances it to the equivalent of a magic weapon +2 against a particular type of creature or being, choosing from animals, beastmen, enchanted creatures, dragons, fantastic creatures (excluding dragons), giants, oozes, undead, and vermin. The caster must specify the type of creature affected. Weapons that are already enchanted gain an additional +2 against the type of creature while the spell is in effect. A single casting will effect 20 arrows, 2 one-handed weapons, or 1 two-handed weapon.

#### Banner of Invincibility
| Range:    | touch
| :
| Eldritch  | 6 (White)
| Duration: | 1 turn
This spell imbues the banner, pennant, standard , or other flag of an adventuring party or military unit with powerful protective magic. While the spell is in effect, the bearer of the flag and all friendly creatures within 10’ of the flag are immune to normal weapons. Magic or silver weapons can harm the protected creatures, but any number of normal swords, arrows, clubs, or natural weapons will be fended off. Monsters which themselves can only be affected by silver or magical weapons can still harm the protected creatures, however, as can monsters with 5 HD or more through natural ferocity.

Bearing a flag counts as wielding a weapon or shield (e.g. the flag bearer can bear the flag in one hand and either wield a one-handed weapon or a shield in his other hand). The spell ends if the bearer drops the flag (voluntarily or involuntarily), if the flag is destroyed, if the spell is dispelled, or when the duration expires.

If used during a battle, the banner of invincibility can protect all man-sized creatures in a platoon-sized unit of formed foot. The unit cannot be damaged by missile or melee attacks from units of less than 5 HD without appropriate weapons, and is never considered threatened by enemy units that are unable to damage it. The effect ends if the unit ever recoils, flees, or routs.
 
#### Bath of the Goddess
| Range:    | touch
| :
| Eldritch  | 5 (White)
| Duration: | permanent
When cast, bath of the goddess instantly transforms a willing living creature into a creature of the same type but opposite sex. The creature gains all of the primary and secondary characteristics of its new sex (external and internal, including reproductive capacity if of breeding age), resembling an opposite-gender twin of its old self.

If cast on a creature that has been sexually altered (e.g. a eunuch), the creature will suffer an equivalent alteration to its new form. If cast on a creature of a species that has only one sex, the spell has no effect. If cast on a creature of a species that has multiple sexes, or on an intersexed creature of a predominantly sex-binary species, the caster may choose the sex that results. (A male or female creature could be transformed into an intersexed creature by this spell if desired. It is rumored that some mystery cults require this of their high-level religious figures.)  The subject must be willing to accept the change.

The spell is permanent until dispelled by either dispel magic or a second casting of this spell, at which time the subject reverts to its original sex. No actual bathing is required to cast this spell; it just takes its name from a classical myth about a handsome priest who was transformed into a bladedancer after unintentionally bathing in a moon-lit pond that Ianna herself had recently bathed in.

#### Battering Ram
| Range:| 90’
| :
|Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
|Duration: | instantaneous
With this spell, the caster smashes a wooden or stone object or structure as if with an invisible battering ram. The spell deals 1d4 shp of damage to the object or structure struck – sufficient to knock down an oak door, break off a parapet, etc. The impact of the battering ram will blast shards of stone or splinters of wood from the object structure, dealing 5d6 damage to all creatures within 5’. Affected creatures that make a successful saving throw versus Blast reduce damage by half. The battering ram cannot directly target creatures or areas of open ground. An interior floor can be targeted as a structure only if the caster is at least one story above it.

#### Blindness		
| Range:| 60’
| :
|Eldritch| 2 (Black)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell can magically destroy a target creature’s eyes. If the target fails a saving throw versus Death, it is rendered permanently blind. A blinded creature suffers -2 to surprise rolls and -4 to all attack throws and has its movement reduced to ¼ its normal rate. Only cure blindness or other magical healing can restore the target’s sight.

#### Body Swap
|Range: |	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:|	permanent
This spell can cause a pair of living creatures to permanently take on each other’s forms. Each target gains the physical capabilities, statistics, physical attacks, and special abilities of the new form while retaining its own mental abilities. Each target retains the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed.

Incorporeal and gaseous creatures cannot be targeted by this spell, nor can creatures with more HD than the caster’s level of experience. The caster must touch both creatures when casting the spell. Touching an unwilling creature requires a successful attack throw, so this spell is usually cast only when one or both of the creatures are willing and/or helpless. Each creature may make a saving throw versus Spells to resist the body swap. If either creature saves, the spell has no effect.

Once the body swap occurs, it lasts indefinitely. If dispelled by dispel magic, the two creatures immediately swap back to their original forms. If the body swap is dispelled after one of the creatures has died, then the surviving creature must make a saving throw v. Death. If the throw fails, the creature returns to its original (dead) form and dies. If the throw succeeds, the surviving creature retains the new form.
 
#### Boil Blood		

|Range:| 150’
| :
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
| Duration:| instantaneous
This spell can boil the blood of a living creature, thereby inflicting terrible wounds and great suffering, and possibly causing it to explode like an overheated furnace. The target must make a saving throw versus Blast. If the save fails, the creature suffers 8d8 points of damage and is stunned during its next initiative. If the save succeeds the creature suffers half damage and is not stunned.

In either case, if the target is reduced to 0 hp or less by the spell, it detonates in an explosion of boiling blood, scalding puss, and melted organs. The explosion kills the target instantly. Each creature or object within 5’ of the exploding target suffers 1d6 points of damage, or half that on a successful saving throw versus Blast.

#### Bloody Flux

| Range: |90’
| :
|Eldritch| 2 (Black)
| Duration:| special
The caster calls down a bloody flux on a target creature within range. The target must make a saving throw versus Death. On a successful save, this spell has no effect. On a failed save, the target begins vomiting blood. A vomiting creature cannot take attack, cast spells, move, speak or take any other action (though it can defend itself). When its initiative number comes up, a vomiting creature suffers 1d12 points of damage from its gory retching, then makes another saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends.  If the save fails, the target continues vomiting blood. The bloody flux continues until the effect is dispelled, the creature dies, or the creature successfully saves. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effect.

#### Burning Sparks		
| Range:| 30’
| :
| Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
| Duration:| instantaneous
With this spell, the caster inflames an existing fire, causing it to cast out scorching embers at those nearby. All creatures within 5’ of the fire can be targeted by the spell, but the caster can select fewer targets to be harmed if he desires. The damage dealt by this spell is dependent on the size of the fire used as its source, per the accompanying table. A successful saving throw versus Blast will reduce damage by half.

| Fire Size|	Damage
| :
| Candle|	1 (1 target only)
| Torch|	1d3
| Campfire |	1d6
| Small bonfire|	2d6
| Large bonfire|	4d6

#### Blinding Flash

| Range: | 60’
|:
| Eldritch| 1 (Grey)
| Duration: | 1 round per level
When this spell is cast, a bright flash of light dazzles everything and everyone within a 10’ radius area. Creatures within the area of effect must make a saving throw versus Blast or be blinded for the duration of the spell.

#### Brazen Bull

|Range:| 10’
| :
| Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
| Duration:| special
This spell summons a fire elemental out of an existing source of flame within range. The AC, HD, and damage characteristics of the fire elemental are determined by the size of the fire source used to summon it. See the entry under Elementals in the Monsters chapter of ACKS for other statistics. The flame is consumed by the summoning process. By default, the shape of the summoned fire elemental is that of a brazen bull, but the elemental can take the shape of any non-flying creature held sacred by the gods of the caster’s faith.  Once the elemental appears, it serves the caster indefinitely, provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so on his Initiative if in combat). If the caster loses concentration, control of the conjured elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The uncontrolled elemental will immediately return to its own sphere.

| Fire Size |	Elemental Characteristics
| :
| Torch |	AC 1, 1 HD, Dmg 1d3
| Campfire |	AC 3, HD 2, Dmg 1d4
| Small bonfire |	AC 5, HD 4, Dmg 1d6
| Large bonfire |	AC 7, HD 8, Dmg 1d8

#### Call of the Ancient Tusk

|Range:|	Special
| :
|Eldritch| 5 (White)|
|Duration:|	1 day
This spell calls a mastodon to the caster to serve as a companion and/or mount (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). In regions where mastodons are extinct, the spell calls a very large and powerful elephant with characteristics identical to a mastodon.

When called, the mastodon will travel to the caster’s destination at its wilderness movement rate. If the spell is cast in a wilderness hex of terrain with an indigenous mastodon or elephant population, the mastodon will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 120 minutes (12 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest wilderness hex of native terrain. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a mastodon lair is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the mastodon will travel as close as it can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the mastodon will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friend and companion. The spell persists until the mastodon is slain, the spell is dispelled, or one day passes (at which time the mastodon departs). If the spell is cast again when the mastodon is about to depart, it will remain for another day.

This spell does not conjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the mastodon into battle do so at their own risk.

#### Call of the Galloping Herd

| Range:|	Special
| :
| Eldritch | 4 (White)
| Duration: |	1 day
This spell calls one or more horses to the caster to serve as steeds for him and his companions (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). The number of horses called by the spell is determined by the type of horse called and the caster’s level.

The adjoining table shows the types of horses that can be called, the number of each type called by caster level. When called, the horses will travel to the caster’s destination at their wilderness movement rate. The caster can freely choose the type of horses called. If the spell is cast in a hex of inhabited terrain, or in a borderlands or wilderness hex of clear, grass, hills, or scrub terrain, the horses will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 90 minutes (9 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest such hex. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a herd of horses is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the horses will travel as close as they can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the horses will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions. They can be handled as mounts, war mounts, or workbeasts as if trained in the role. The spell persists until all the horses are slain, the spell is dispelled, or one day passes (at which time the horses depart).  If the spell is cast again when the horses are about to depart, they will remain for another day.

This spell does *not* conjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the horses into battle do so at their own risk.

#### Call of the Giant Eagle
| Range:|	Special
| :
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|Duration:|	1 day
This spell calls a large roc to the caster to serve as a winged steed (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). When called, the roc will travel by air to the caster’s destination at its flying movement rate. If called in a 24-mile wilderness hex of mountains terrain, the roc will take 1d6 hours to arrive. If the roc is called outside a wilderness hex of mountains terrain, the time to arrive is increased by 1 hour per 24-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest 24-mile wilderness hex of mountains terrain. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the roc will travel as close as it can to the caster and then circle the sky in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the roc will understand the spellcaster’s speech and - provided that the caster is Lawful - will serve as a loyal mount for him or another that the caster directs. The roc will only grudgingly serve a Neutral caster or rider, however, and if asked to perform a Chaotic action or assist a Chaotic creature it will immediately depart. Otherwise, the spell persists until the roc is slain, the spell is dispelled, or one day passes (at which time the roc departs).  If the spell is cast again when the roc is about to depart, it will remain for another day.

This spell does not conjure up saddle and tack, nor does it automatically grant the rider the equivalent of Riding proficiency, so unproficient characters who ride the roc into battle do so at their own risk.

#### Call of the Great Cats

|Range:|	Special
| :
| Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration:|	1 day
This spell calls one or more large cats to the caster to serve as companions (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). The number of cats called by the spell is determined by the type of cat called and the caster’s level.

The adjoining table shows the types of cats that can be called, the number of each type called by caster level, and the native terrain for each type. When called, the cats will travel to the caster’s destination at their wilderness movement rate. The caster can freely choose the type of cats called, but the time required for them to arrive will be greater if the spell is cast outside of their native terrain because the cats will have further to travel. If the spell is cast in a wilderness hex of their native terrain, the cats will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 90 minutes (9 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest wilderness hex of native terrain. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a lair of large cats is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the cats will travel as close as they can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the cats will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friends and companions. The spell persists until all the cats are slain, the spell is dispelled, or one day passes (at which time the cats depart).  If the spell is cast again when the cats are about to depart, they will remain for another day.

#### Call of the Leviathan

|Range:|	Special
| :
| Eldritch| 6 (White)
|Duration:|	1 day
This spell calls a sperm whale to the caster to serve as a companion (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). When called, the sperm whale will travel to the caster’s destination at its wilderness movement rate. The spell can only be cast in an ocean hex, or from a point in a hex adjacent to an ocean hex with line of sight to the ocean. The whale will take 4d6 turns to arrive. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a pod of whales is nearby. The whale will travel as close as it can to the caster (just off shore, near his boat, etc.) and then wait in that vicinity. For the duration of the spell, the whale will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friend and companion. It will sing for him, allow him to ride on it as it swims through the waves, and even attack enemy vessels or sea monsters at his request. The spell persists until the whale is slain, the spell is dispelled, or either one day passes (at which time the whale departs). The whale will also depart after any fight in which it loses ½ or more of its hit points. If the spell is cast again when the whale is about to depart, it will remain for another day.

#### Call of the Wild Bear
|Range:|	Special
| :
|Eldritch| 3 (White)
|Duration:|	1 day
This spell calls a bear to the caster to serve as a companion (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). The adjoining table shows the types of bears that can be called and the native terrain for each type. When called, the bear will travel to the caster’s destination at its wilderness movement rate. The caster can freely choose the type of bear called, but the time required for it to arrive will be greater if the spell is cast outside of its native terrain because the bear will have further to travel. If the spell is cast in a wilderness hex of its native terrain, the bear will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 120 minutes (12 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest wilderness hex of native terrain. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a bear den is nearby. If called while the caster is unreachable (deep in a dungeon, for example), the bear will travel as close as it can to the caster and then wait in that vicinity.

For the duration of the spell, the bear will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friend and companion. The spell persists until the bear is slain, the spell is dispelled, or one day passes (at which time the bear departs). If the spell is cast again when the bear is about to depart, it will remain for another day.

When called, the wolf will travel to the caster’s destination at its wilderness movement rate. If the spell is cast in a wilderness hex of a wolf’s native terrain (woods, hills, or mountains), the wolf will take 1d6 turns to arrive. If the spell is cast in any other type of hex, the time to arrive is increased by 90 minutes (9 turns) per 6-mile hex between the caster’s hex and the nearest wilderness hex of native terrain. The time to arrival may be much shorter if the Judge has determined that a wolf den is nearby.

For the duration of the spell, the wolf will understand the spellcaster’s speech and serve as his loyal friend and companion. The spell persists until the wolf is slain, the spell is dispelled, or one day passes (at which time the wolf departs). If the spell is cast again when the wolf is about to depart, it will remain for another day.

#### Call of the Wolf Pack
|Range:|	Special
| :
| Eldritch| 2 (White)
| Duration:|	1 day
This spell calls a pack of wolves to the caster to serve as companions (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). One wolf will respond to the call plus one additional wolf for every two levels of experience the caster possesses, rounded down. When called, the wolves will travel to the caster’s destination at their wilderness movement rate.

If the spell is cast again when the wolves are about to depart, they will remain for another day.
 
#### Capsizing Wave
| Range:| 150’
| :
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell smashes a sea vessel within range with a capsizing wave capable of sinking even the largest sailing ships. The wave is approximately 150’ long, 15’ high, and 4’ thick. On his initiative number, the captain of the target vessel may use his action to  attempt to steer through the wave. Steering through the wave requires a Seafaring proficiency throw. The target value of the proficiency throw is based on the speed of the vessel, as shown on the accompanying table. Master mariners (characters with Seafaring rank 3) gain a +5 bonus on the throw.

If the captain does not attempt to steer the vessel through the wave, or if the captain’s proficiency throw fails, the vessel is struck on its broadside by the wave. It suffers 50-80 (1d4+4 x 10) shp of damage. Each crewmember on deck must make a saving throw versus Blast. Crewmembers that fail their saving throws suffer 1d6 points of damage and are swept overboard. If the captain’s proficiency throw succeeds, the vessel suffers only 25-40 (1d4+4 x 5) shp of damage, and the crewmembers are not affected.

A vessel reduced to 0 shp by may no longer move under its own power or attack with any ship-mounted weaponry, and will sink in 1d10 rounds. Any crew still on board may attack with personal weapons during this time. When the vessel sinks, or when knocked overboard, crew must begin making swimming throws each round. See Sea Combat in ACKS, p. XX for more details.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses sees Raknar the Red-Handed sailing towards his island sanctum is at the helm of his longship, the Red Viper (70 shp). When Raknar’s vessel gets to a range of 150’, Ra-Ramses smashes it with a capsizing wave. On Raknar’s initiative, he attempts to steer through the wave. Raknar’s longship is under sail, so it has a movement rate of 60’ per round. Therefore he must make a Seafaring proficiency throw with a target value of 15+. (If the longship had been under oar, its movement rate of 150’ per round would have reduced the target value to just 5+!) Fortunately, Raknar has three ranks of Seafaring proficiency, granting him a +5 bonus to the throw. Unfortunately, he rolls a 3, which still fails. The Red Viper is struck on its broadside and suffers 1d4+4 x 10 shp of damage. Ra-Ramses rolls a 3, so the total is 70 shp. That reduces the longship to 0 shp, and it will sink in 1d10 rounds. <br>
Meanwhile, Raknar and his 75 crew must each make a saving throw versus Blast. Those that fail suffer 1d6 points of damage and are swept overboard. Raknar’s ill-luck continues as he fails his saving throw. The barbarian is carried into the murky waters…

| Vessel Movement Rate |	Seafaring Throw
| :
| 150’/round or faster|	5+
|120’/round|	11+
|90’/round|	13+
|60’/round|	15+
|45’/round|	17+
|30’/round or slower|	19+

#### Choking Grip		

|Range:| 30’
| :
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|Duration: |special
This spell creates an invisible grip around the throat of the target creature. The target must make a saving throw versus Death. If the target’s saving throw succeeds, it resists the spell. If the target’s saving throw fails, it begins choking. A choking creature suffers 1d6 points of damage and cannot attack, cast spells, move, speak, or take any other action (although it can still defend itself).

When the caster’s next initiative number comes up, if the caster maintains concentration on the spell, then the choking target must make another saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the target continues choking. It suffers another 1d6 points of damage and still cannot take any action.  The choking grip lasts until dispelled, the caster stops concentrating upon it, or the target makes a successful saving throw and ends the spell.

#### Circle of Agony		
|Range:| 30’
| :
|Eldritch| 5 (Black)
|Duration:| special
This spell can inflict agonizing pain on one or more target creatures within range. The caster may target one creature per level of experience. Each target must make a saving throw versus Death. On a successful save, the spell has no effect on the target. On a failed save, the target is agonized. While agonized, a creature is helpless and cannot attack, cast spells, or move. It gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). It can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against agonized creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs it. The agonized creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against agonized creatures automatically hit if the If the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the helpless creature. If the attacker is not engaged, and his attack is capable of damaging the agonized creature, then the agonized creature may be automatically slain. The attacker may not cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the helpless creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

When its initiative number comes up, an agonized creature suffers 1d4 points of damage from the body-wracking pain, then makes another saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell ends. If the save fails, the creature remains agonized. The effects of a circle of agony continue until dispelled, or the target(s) either die(s) or successfully save(s). The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain the effects.

#### Circling Winds		
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch |2 (Grey)		
|Duration: |concentration
The caster raises up a sphere of howling winds that surrounds him in a 10’ radius. Any creatures approaching within 5’ of the exterior of the circling winds are subject to attack as if from a 2 HD monster with one attack dealing 1d8 points of damage. Any creature attempting to pass into the circling winds must make a saving throw versus Paralysis or be forced back 5’. (Creatures of Large size or greater gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category above man-sized.)  The circling winds also completely block small non-magical missile attacks, such as normal arrows, sling bullets, crossbow bolts, and thrown daggers, from passing inside. The circling winds do not block missile attacks made by creatures inside the winds, nor do they prevent creatures inside the winds from exiting. The circling winds may be evoked so that they appear where creatures already are; creatures who make a successful saving throw versus Blast are able to dive into or out of the circling winds (their choice) without being harmed. The circling winds spell lasts as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrates on it, unless dispelled.

####Clairaudience, Greater

|Range:| 500 miles
| :
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|Duration:| concentration
This spell enables the caster to hear the sounds in another area through the ears of a selected type of living creatures, such as bats, hawks, or rats. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 500 miles away, of the first creature he wishes to clairaudiently contact. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the next closest creature of the appropriate type will be contacted instead. No saving throw is allowed, and the subject is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be heard. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, and the caster must choose another subject in this case. A lead barrier between the caster and the subject creature(s) will block the effect. This spell is difficult to cast, taking one full turn, and is so draining that it can be used but once per day.

#### Clairvoyance, Greater

|Range:	|500 miles
| :
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
| Duration:|	concentration
This spell enables the caster to see into other areas through the eyes of a selected type of living creatures, such as bats, hawks, or rats. The caster must specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum of 500 miles away, of the first creature he wishes to clairvoyantly contact. If there is no appropriate creature in that area, the next closest creature of the appropriate type will be contacted instead. No saving throw is allowed, and the subject is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may choose another subject creature after at least a turn has passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, and the caster must choose another subject in this case. A lead barrier between the caster and the subject creature(s) will block the effect. This spell is difficult to cast, taking one full turn, and is so draining that it can be used but once per day.

#### Cloud of Poison

|Range:|	special
| :
| Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
| Duration:|	 6 turns
This spell draws together a cloud of poison from the foul miasmas of the atmosphere. Because the spell draws its power from natural miasmas, it can only be cast outdoors or in a ventilated room. The cloud is 30’ in diameter and spreads out from the caster’s fingertips. The cloud moves at a rate of 20' per round away from the caster. The poison gas is heavier than air and will sink down holes or slide downhill; it is broken up by trees or thick vegetation. Each round they are within the cloud, creatures of fewer than 5 Hit Dice or levels must save versus Poison or die, taking 1 point of damage even if the save is successful. Creatures having 5 or more Hit Dice or levels take 1 point of damage each round they are within the cloud. The cloud persists until dispelled by magic, dispersed by strong winds, or 6 turns elapse.
 
#### Cone of Frost		
|Range:| 0’
| :
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration: |instantaneous
This spell conjures a cone of freezing water 60’ long and 30’ wide stretching from the caster’s hands. The cone of frost deals 6d4 points of damage to all creatures within its area of effect. Creatures who make a successful saving throw versus Blast suffer half damage. The cone of frost also damages objects in the area and extinguishes any small normal fires (campfires, torches, etc.).

#### Conjure Cacodemon Spawm
|Range: |	240'
| :
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
| Duration: |	special (1 day)
A portal to the Outer Darkness is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a cacodemon spawn with 2 HD and two special abilities. Only one cacodemon spawn may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the cacodemon spawn appears, it serves the caster for up to one full day, provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of the cacodemon spawn, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so on his Initiative if in combat). If the caster loses concentration, control of the conjured cacodemon spawn is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the cacodemon spawn once control has been lost. An uncontrolled cacodemon spawn may, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long.

Cacodemons are highly variable in form and abilities. The first time this spell is cast, the caster should choose the form of the cacodemon spawn conjured, while the Judge should roll or choose its special abilities. The cacodemon spawn should then be assigned a name for later reference. Thereafter, the caster can choose to conjure any named spawn he has previously conjured and safely dispelled, or conjure a new spawn with a different form and special abilities. See the Cacodemon entry in the Heroic Monsters chapter for statistics for more information.

EXAMPLE: The first time Ra-Ramses conjures a cacodemon spawn, he selects the monadine form. The Judge determines it has the special abilities of swallow attack and grab and assigns it the name Ixubix the Enveloping Horror. Ra-Ramses uses Ixubix to envelop and dissolve a rival for power in the local temple, then dismisses it. Because he safely dismissed Ixubix, he can conjure it again in the future. The second time Ra-Ramses conjures a spawn, he can conjure either Ixubix or a new spawn. He chooses to conjure Ixubix. Unfortunately, on this casting Ixubix is slain in combat. Because Ixubix was slain rather than safely dispelled, Ra-Ramses cannot conjure it again.

#### Conjure Elemental		

| Range:|	240'
| :
| Eldritch| 5 (Black)
|Duration:|	special (indefinite)
A portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a 16-HD elemental from that sphere. See the entry under Elementals in the Monsters chapter of ACKS for statistics for the conjured elemental. At most one elemental of each type may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental appears, it serves the caster indefinitely, provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so on his Initiative if in combat). If the caster loses concentration, control of the conjured elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the elemental once control has been lost. An uncontrolled elemental may, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long.

#### Conjure Dybbuk
|Range:|	240'
| :
| Eldritch| 4 (Black)
|Duration:|	special (12 turns)
A portal to the Outer Darkness is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a dybbuk with 14 HD and three special abilities. Only one dybbuk may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the dybbuk appears, it serves the caster for up to two hours (12 turns), provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to conjure cacodemon spawn.

#### Conjure Fiend
|Range:|	240'
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:|	special (12 turns)
A portal to the Outer Darkness is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a fiend with 18 HD and four special abilities. Only one fiend may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the fiend appears, it serves the caster for up to two hours (12 turns), provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to conjure cacodemon spawn.

#### Conjure Genie
|Range:|	240'
| :
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:|	special (indefinite)
A portal to one of the Elemental Spheres of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a genie from that sphere. See the entries for Djinn and Efreeti in *ACKS* and for Dao and Marid in *Lairs & Encounters* for statistics for the conjured genie. At most one genie of each type may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the genie appears, it serves the caster indefinitely, provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. Spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate results in loss of concentration. The caster, while in control of the genie, can dismiss it to its native sphere at will (doing so on his Initiative if in combat). If the caster loses concentration, control of the conjured genie is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then seeks to attack the caster and all others in its path. Only dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the genie once control has been lost. An uncontrolled genie may, of course, choose to return to its home sphere on its own; such creatures will never choose to remain away from their sphere of existence for long. A conjured genie is not under sufficient control to be forced to cast wish.

#### Conjure Hellion
|Range:|	240'
| :
|Eldritch| 3 (Black)
|Duration:|	special (1 day)
A portal to the Outer Darkness is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure a hellion with 8 HD and two special abilities. Only one hellion may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the hellion appears, it serves the caster for up to one full day, provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to conjure cacodemon spawn.

#### Conjure Imp
|Range:|	240'
| :
| Eldritch| 2 (Black)
|	Duration:|	special (1 day)
A portal to the Outer Darkness is opened, allowing the spellcaster to conjure an imp with 4 HD and two special abilities. Only one imp may be conjured by the caster in a given day. Once the imp appears, it serves the caster for up to one full day, provided that the caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature. This spell is otherwise identical to conjure cacodemon spawn.

#### Contact Other Sphere
|Range: | self
| :
| Eldritch| 5 (Black)		
|Duration:| special

This spell sends the caster’s mind to a distant sphere of existence, where he can receive advice and information from a one of the great powers that dwells therein, such as an angel, demon, demigod, elemental, or even a god. When the spell is cast, the caster chooses how distant a sphere he wishes to contact - the more distant the sphere, the more powerful the being contacted.  For game purposes, distance is defined abstractly as 1 – 12; the Judge may assign these values to specific spheres of existence, higher dimensions, and so on as appropriate to his campaign setting.

The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. He may ask questions at the rate of one per round and it is answered by the contacted power during the same round. The caster must concentrate on maintaining the spell while asking questions. The powers reply in a language the caster understands, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to questions. Each time a question is asked, roll on the table below to see if the power knows the answer, then roll to see if the power answers truthfully. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer.  

When the caster has finished asking his questions, roll to see if he goes insane. The probability of insanity is related to the sphere contacted – more distant spheres are more likely to cause insanity. See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt.

*Don’t Know:* The entity may or may not know the answer, and may or may not tell the caster the truth of whether it knows or not.

*True Answer:* The caster gets a true, one-word answer.  Otherwise, the entity lies, and the lie is undetectable.

*Insanity:* The chance that the caster goes insane at the effort of communication. A character that goes insane will remain that way for the same number of weeks as the total number of questions asked, and the player cannot play the character during this time. The base chance indicated on the table is reduced by 5% for every level the caster is above 11. For example, a 14th level caster receives -15% to the insanity roll.

**Eldritch Dreams of Clark Ashton Smith Memorial Rule (Optional):** In lieu of asking for advice or information, the caster of Contact Other Sphere may ask the power to provide him with the formula to an eldritch spell (or ceremony). Asking for a spell formula counts as asking one question per level (e.g. asking for a 1st level spell counts as asking one question). Note that acquiring the spell formula is not the same as learning the spell. The spell may be added to the caster’s repertoire if the character can still learn new spells of that level. If the character’s repertoire is full, or if the spell is of too high level for him to learn, then the spell cannot be put into the repertoire, but the formula may be saved to be put into the repertoire in the future. It takes one week of study to add a spell to the character’s repertoire from the formula.

|Sphere|	Don’t Know|	True Answer|	Insanity
| :
|1|	85%|	40%|	1%
|2|	80%|	45%|	3%
|3|	75%|	50%|	5%
|4|	70%|	55%|	10%
|5|	65%|	60%|	15%
|6|	60%|	65%|	20%
|7|	50%|	70%|	25%
|8|	40%|	75%|	30%
|9|	30%|	80%|	35%

|12|	5%|	95%|	50%

#### Counterspell		

|Range:| 120’
| :
|Eldritch| 1 (White)
|Duration:| instantaneous
The caster can use counterspell to dispel a single ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object within range. If counterspell is used on a hostile creature, or on an object held by a hostile creature, the creature can ignore the counterspell with a successful saving throw versus Spells. Otherwise, one spell or effect cast by a character of equal or lower level than the counterspell caster's level is ended automatically. (If the creature or object is affected by multiple spells or effects, roll randomly to determine which one is cancelled.) Spells or effects created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the counterspell will fail for each level the spell or effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster counterspelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure. Some spells cannot be ended by counterspell; this specifically includes any magical disease, geas, quest, petrification from a flesh to stone spell, and any curse, including those created by bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.

#### Corrupting Dream
| Range:| 500 miles
| :
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:| 1 round per level
This spell permits the caster to influence a target character within range by means of a corrupting dream. The caster must be able to identify the target – referencing a correct name (“Audarius Tarkaun”), unique title (“the Tarkaun of Aura”), or unique possession (“the owner of the Sword of the Dawn”) will suffice. The caster then spends 10 minutes (1 turn) casting the spell, during which time he enters a state of lucid dreaming. The caster is unaware of his surroundings and completely helpless while in this dream state.

If the target is awake when the caster completes the spellcasting, the caster knows it, and can either end his dream-state (and the spell) or can remain in the dream state while waiting for the target to fall asleep, at which point the spell begins.

If the target is asleep when the caster completes the spellcasting, he must immediately make a saving throw versus Spells. If the saving throw succeeds, the target’s subconscious refuses the caster entry into its dreams. If the saving throw fails, the caster and the target begin to share a lucid dream during which the caster can attempt to corrupt the target. Each round of the corrupting dream, the caster can communicate with the target as desired, offering a mix of half-truths, lies, and appeals to the target’s baser instincts. The caster can control his appearance within the dream, as well as the environment of the dream itself, in order to make his communication more acceptable to the target.

When the target awakens, he recalls the corrupting dream perfectly and must choose whether to believe or disbelieve the messages of the dream. If the target believes the dream, he gains 1d4 points of corruption. If the target disbelieves the dream, he suffers a -1 penalty to attack throws, proficiency throws, and saving throws for the next 24 hours due to fear and self-doubt. If the target is subjected to additional corrupting dreams while a penalty is in effect, all the penalties are cumulative.

A target cannot be affected by corrupting dream if he sleeps within a pinnacle of good. A salving rest will remove any accumulated penalties from corrupting dreams, but will not remove any corruption the target may have acquired.

#### Crafting

|Range:| touch
| :
|Eldritch| 4 (White)
|Duration:| special
This dweomer improves the target’s Art or Crafting proficiency by one rank for purposes of completing one project (e.g. forging one sword, painting one painting, composing one song). Unproficient characters become apprentices, apprentices become journeymen, journeymen become masters, masters become grand masters, and grand masters become capable of creating magic items at twice the base time and cost of a mage. The spell expires when the project is completed or when a day passes without the target working on the project for at least 8 hours.

#### Cure Critical Wounds*

|Range:| touch
| :
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration:| instantaneous
The caster heals the creature touched. The creature instantly regains hit points as if it had rested for five days. The spell may also be used to cure paralysis, but does not then cure any points of damage. The spell will never increase a creature’s hit points beyond the normal amount.

EXAMPLE: Marcus has 42 hp. According to the Base Healing Rate table, he will recover 2d6 hp per day of rest.  He has recently been mauled by an ogre, and has taken 37 points of damage, reducing him to 5 hp. Balbus, a 14th level caster, casts cure critical wounds on Marcus. Marcus recovers as if he had rested for five days. Marcus rolls 5 x 2d6 or 10d6, and recovers 38 hp. That’s more than the damage he suffered, so he is restored to his full 42 hp.

The reverse, cause critical wounds, damages the creature touched. The creature instantly loses a number of hit points equal to the amount it might have gained for an equivalent amount of healing, e.g. five days rest. The reversed spell can decrease  a creature’s hit points below zero.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses, a 9th level caster, casts cause critical wounds on Marcus. He succeeds on the required attack throw to touch Marcus. Marcus immediately loses hit points equal in number to the amount he might have recovered had he rested for five days. Since Marcus’s Base Healing Rate is 2d6, Ra-Ramses rolls 5 x 2d6 or 10d6, and the result of the dice is 47. Marcus loses 47 hp, reducing him to -5. A critical wound indeed!

Undead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by cure critical wounds and healed by cause critical wounds.

#### Cure Light Wounds*

|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 1
|Duration:| instantaneous

This spell works exactly like cure critical wounds, save that the creature touched regains hit points equal to its Base Healing Rate, as if it had rested for one day. The reverse, cause light wounds, also works exactly like cause critical wounds, except that the creature touched loses hit points equal to its Base Healing Rate, the amount it would have gained had it rested for one day.

EXAMPLE: Had Balbus cast cure light wounds, Marcus would have recovered 2d6 hp.

#### Cure Major Wounds*
|Range:| touch
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (White)		
|Duration: |instantaneous

This spell works exactly like cure critical wounds, save that the creature touched regains hit points as if it had rested for three days. The reverse, cause major wounds, also works exactly like cause critical wounds, except that the creature touched loses hit points equal to the amount it would have gained had it rested for three days.

EXAMPLE: Had Balbus cast cure major wounds, Marcus would have recovered 6d6 hp.
 
#### Cure Moderate Wounds*
|Range:| touch
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (White)		
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell works exactly like cure critical wounds, save that the creature touched regains hit points equal to twice its Base Healing Rate, as if it had rested for two days. The reverse, cause moderate wounds, also works exactly like cause critical wounds, except that the creature touched loses hit points equal to twice its Base Healing Rate, the amount it would have gained had it rested for two days.

EXAMPLE: Had Balbus cast cure moderate wounds, Marcus would have recovered 4d6 hp.

#### Cure Serious Wounds*
|Range:	|touch
|:
|Divine| 4	(White)		
|Duration: |instantaneous
This spell works exactly like cure critical wounds, save that the creature touched regains hit points as if it had rested for four days. The reverse, cause serious wounds, also works exactly like cause critical wounds, except that the creature touched loses hit points equal to the amount it would have gained had it rested for four days
.
EXAMPLE: Had Balbus cast cure serious wounds, Marcus would have recovered 8d6 hp.

#### Dark Whisper
|Range:| touch
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Black)		
|Duration:| instantaneous
With this spell, the caster can damage the soul of a target creature by whispering terrible words into its ear. A successful attack throw is required unless the target creature is helpless. Upon hearing the dark whisper the target creature must make a saving throw versus Death. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the saving throw fails, the creature suffers one of the following effects, selected by the caster:

*	Plagued by whispers from beyond the grave, the creature suffers a -2 to hear noise throws and -2 to surprise rolls.
*	Disturbed by truths it cannot unhear, the creature mutters to itself constantly. It cannot move silently or surprise opponents, and its spellcasting initiative rolls are at -1.
*	Nightmares wrack the creature. Each time it attempts to rest, it must roll 1d6. On a 1, it tosses and turns all night, cannot recover spells, and does not heal.
*	The creature attempts to drown its horror in consumption. It suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to all saving throws every hour until it consumes something (smoke, alcohol, etc.)

The caster may also invent his own whisper, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. There is no limit to the number of different whispers a creature may suffer from. The effects of a dark whisper cannot be dispelled, but can be removed with a remove curse spell by a caster of equal or higher level to the dark whisper’s caster.

#### Deafness
|Range:|	60’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Black)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
This spell can magically destroys a target creature’s ears. If the target fails a saving throw versus Death, it is rendered permanently deaf. A deaf creature is easy to sneak up on, and suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls. Due to its inability to hear itself, it has a -4 penalty on ceremony throws and spellsinging throws. It has a 2 in 6 chance of failing any attempt to cast a spell, read a scroll, or utter a command word. Other penalties may apply in certain social settings or circumstances at the Judge’s discretion. Only magical healing can restore the hearing of a target affected by this spell.

#### Deathless Minion
|Range: 	30’
| :
|Arcane| 2
|Duration:|	1 hour
This spell raises the bones or body of a single dead creature within range as an undead skeleton or zombie that follows the caster's spoken commands. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

Skeletons will have Hit Dice equal to the number the monster had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies will have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life. Unlike animate dead, the HD of the skeleton or zombie created are not limited by the caster’s level. However, a deathless minion lasts for just one hour, after which it crumbles to dust.

**Note that the spell effects above should revise and replace the deathless minion spell in *Player’s Companion*. See p. XX of this book for an explanation why.**


#### Destroy Dead
|Range:| 150’
| :
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|Duration:| Instantaneous
This spell can destroy the bones or body of a single undead skeleton or zombie of 8 Hit Dice or less within range. If the target fails a saving throw versus Death, it immediately crumbles to dust. If cast on an unanimated skeleton or cadaver, the skeleton or cadaver crumbles to dust without a saving throw. The spell has no effect on living creatures or on undead other than skeletons and zombies.

##### Delay Death
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration:|	special
This spell extends the time period available to prevent a critically wounded, grievously wounded, or mortally wounded character from dying. A critically wounded character normally will die unless healed to 1hp within one day; if delay death is cast on the character, the time is extended to one week. A grievously wounded character normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one turn; with delay death, the time is extended to one day. A mortally wounded character normally will die unless healed to 1 hp within one round; with delay death, the time is extended to one hour. Delay death cannot aid a character who has been instantly killed, nor does it heal permanent wounds suffered. If cast on a healthy character (with 1 hp or more), delay death has no effect at all; it cannot “prevent” death.

#### Display of Power
|Range:|	self
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Grey)
|Duration:|	6 turns
The caster summons forth his magical power in a display that leaves none in doubt as to his magical capacity. The exact effect will depend on the caster’s spell signature. For the duration of the spell, the caster gains a +2 bonus to reaction rolls with creatures he encounters. (This bonus stacks with any bonuses provided by the caster’s ability scores, class, and proficiencies.) If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if charmed while in his presence.

#### Drain Life
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Black)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell drains life energy from the target creature and uses that energy to heal the caster. The caster must touch the target creature, necessitating a melee attack throw against the target if it is an unwilling subject of the spell. When touched, the target may make a saving throw versus Death. If the save fails, the target loses hit points equal to its Base Healing Rate (the amount it would have gained had it rested for one day). If the save succeeds, the target loses hit points equal to one-half its Base Healing Rate. In either case, the caster is simultaneously healed by twice the amount of hit points that the target loses.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses has suffered 11 points of damage in battle with an ogre. On his initiative, he casts drain life on the ogre. Since the ogre is an unwilling target, he must first succeed on a melee attack throw against the ogre to touch it. His attack throw succeeds, so now the ogre may make a saving throw versus Death to resist. The ogre’s saving throw fails, so its loses hit points equal to its Base Healing Rate and Ra-Ramses is simultaneously healed by twice that amount. The ogre has 21 hp, granting it a Base Healing Rate of 1d6.  Ra-Ramses rolls 1d6 and the result is a 4. The ogre suffers 4 hp of damage and Ra-Ramses is healed 8 hp of damage.

#### Drain Life II
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (Black)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell works exactly like drain life except that the creature touched loses hit points equal to its Base Healing Rate x 2, or equal to its Base Healing Rate if its saving throw succeeds. The caster is simultaneously healed by twice the amount of hit points that the target loses.

#### Drain Life III
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell works exactly like drain life except that the creature touched loses hit points equal to its Base Healing Rate x 3, or equal to its Base Healing Rate x 1.5 if its saving throw succeeds. The caster is simultaneously healed by twice the amount of hit points that the target loses.

#### Earth’s Excrescence
|Range:|	60’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
This spell causes an area of earth 15’ in diameter to burst like a swollen boil, casting forth chunks of stone, dirt, and hot mud. All creatures within the area of effect must make a saving throw versus Blast. Creatures that fail the saving throw suffer 3d6 points of damage and are knocked down. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw suffer half damage and retain their footing. Creatures of Huge size or greater cannot be knocked down by this spell, but still suffer damage. The earth’s excrescence can only be brought forth from an area of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The spell does not function on worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or magical materials.

#### Earth’s Maw
|Range:|	60’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
|Duration:|	indefinite
This spell causes a 10’ x 10’ area of earth within range to collapse into a pit 10’ deep. The earth’s maw may be created underfoot of creatures if desired. Any creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw versus Blast. Those that succeed on the saving throw leap to safety. Those that fail the saving throw fall into the pit, suffering 1d6 points of falling damage if not otherwise protected (e.g. by flight or levitation). The earth’s maw can only affect volumes of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The spell does not function on worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or magical material.

Once created, an earth’s maw remains indefinitely. It can be filled manually or dispelled. Dispelling an earth’s maw causes the earth to bubble upward violently and reform. Creatures within a maw that is dispelled are deposited on the surface, but must save versus Blast or suffer 1d6 points of damage and be knocked prone by the roiling tremor.

#### Eldritch Armor
|Range:| self
| :
|Eldritch| 2 (White)
|Duration:| 6 turns

This spell protects the caster with invisible armor of magical force. It grants the caster an Armor Class of 7 against melee and missile attacks of all sorts. The eldritch armor does not stack with worn normal or magical armor, if any, but other enhancements to AC will function normally.

#### Eldritch Protection
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (White)
|Duration:| 9 turns
This spell protects a creature with wards and charms of protection and safety. For the duration of the spell, the target receives a +2 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to all saving throws. The bonus to AC stacks with both worn armor and any other enhancements to AC.

#### Endless Slumber
|Range:| 60’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Black)
|Duration:| until dispelled
This spell places the target creature into a deep, magical sleep. The target can resist the effect with a successful saving throw versus Spells. If the saving throw fails, the target will immediately fall asleep, and thereafter cannot be awoken by any natural means. A dispel magic or remove curse might rouse the affected creature from its bewitched slumber; there is a 5% chance of failure for every level the caster is lower than whoever cast the endless slumber.
 
If desired, the spellcaster may dictate a specific condition under which the target will automatically awaken. Receiving a kiss from royalty of the opposite sex is the most well-known condition associated with endless slumber; others are left to the caster’s imagination and the Judge’s discretion. The condition must be spoken aloud when the spell is cast, and must be something actually possible without resort to magic. A wakening condition is not required, but if one is offered it strengths the spell; an endless slumber with an awakening condition can only be magically lifted by a caster of greater level than the original spellcaster. A divination or fate spell cast upon the affected creature will reveal the specific condition to awaken it (if any).

#### Ensorcellement		
|Range:| 30’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Grey)
|Duration:| 12 rounds
By means of this spell, the caster can mesmerize a humanoid creature of up to 4+1 HD. The target creature must make a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target creature is mesmerized. A mesmerized creature cannot attack, cast spells, move, or speak, and gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). It can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against mesmerized creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the mesmerized creature. The mesmerized creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. The ensorcellement ends only when the creature is slain, the effect is dispelled, or the duration expires.

#### Fangs of the Earth
|Range:| 120’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
|Duration:| instantaneous
When this spell is cast, several fang-like pillars of jagged rock erupt from the earth, possibly impaling up to one creature per level of the caster for 5d6 points of damage each. All of the target creatures must be within a 30’ diameter area of effect, and the spellcaster must make a successful attack throw against each target. The caster may choose which creatures in the area of effect are targeted. The fangs of the earth immediately crumble to dust after damage is dealt. The fangs of the earth can only be brought forth from an area of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The spell does not function on worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or magical materials.

#### Fillet and Serve
|Range:| 90’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Black)
|Duration:| special
This spell can debone a living creature and then animate its extracted skeleton. The target of fillet and serve must make a saving throw versus Death. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target’s own skeleton rips itself out of its body, killing the creature instantly. The extracted skeleton is then animated as an undead creature with Hit Dice equal to the number the monster had in life (for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased). The animated skeleton mindlessly obeys the caster until dispelled or destroyed, or until one day elapses, whereupon the skeleton de-animates and the bones clatter to the floor.

#### Find Place of Power
|Range:|	12 miles
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|Duration:|	concentration
This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to the most potent place of power within 12 miles (i.e. within the area of a 24-mile hex). The caster can search for places of power in general, in which case the spell will reveal the type of place it detects as well as direction and distance. Alternatively, he may specify a particular type of place (e.g. “sinkholes of evil”), in which case the spell will reveal the direction and distance to the most potent place of that type. Find place of power is a complex spell that requires 1 turn (10 minutes) to cast.
 
#### Flay the Slain		
|Range:| 30’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Black)
|Duration:| 1 day
This horrific spell flays the flesh off of one or more eligible corpses in range, then animates the bloody skins as flay fiends (see *Lairs & Encounters*, p. XX, for characteristics). The caster may flay and animate a number of dead corpses up to his caster level each time he casts the spell. A flay fiend can only be created from the corpse of a humanoid of 1 HD or less with mostly intact skin; burned corpses, decayed corpses older than 2 weeks, and corpses of larger humanoids cannot be used. The flay fiends created by this spell last until destroyed or dispelled, or until one day elapses. The flay fiends thereafter crumble into dust.

#### Flesh to Ashes		
|Range:| 90’
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (Black)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell can reduce a target creature to ash and dust. The target creature may make a saving throw versus Death to resist the spell. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target creature and its carried gear are disintegrated. Only creatures made of flesh can be targeted by this spell. Creatures of 8 or more Hit Dice or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other creature that is not truly alive or made of flesh.

#### Force of Impetus
|Range:|	60’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
By means of a magical force, the caster flings one or more objects or creatures within range a distance of up to 20’. The caster can target one creature or object per level of experience. Each object or creature must weigh 2 stone (20lb) per caster level or less. Alternatively, the caster can target a single creature or object weighing 2 stone (20lb) per caster level squared. Each targeted creature can resist the effect on itself or any objects it hold or has on its body with a successful save versus Spells.

The affected creatures or objects can be flung in any direction the caster chooses. If the caster wishes to fling one or more of the affected creatures or objects into another creature, or onto a specific hard-to-reach location (such as a balcony or pit), he must make a successful attack throw. A throw of a single creature or object may be aimed without penalty, but each additional object or creature imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to the caster’s attack throws. If an aimed throw misses, it scatters like thrown oil.

Creatures or objects flung into walls or other hard surface will suffer damage. Creatures or objects will also deal damage to whatever they strike. The amount of damage will be based on the flung creature or object’s weight, as shown on the table below. Large flung objects will also deal damage to an area of effect around their point of impact. Creatures in this area of effect can avoid the damage with a successful saving throw v. Blast, but creatures actually struck by the flung object cannot avoid the damage. Damage from magic converts into SHP at a rate of 1 SHP per 5 points of damage.

EXAMPLE: Baldur, a 9th level Nobiran wizard, is supporting a company of mercenaries during a siege. The mercenaries are suffering from the fire of a light catapult (1,200lb). Baldur casts force of impetus, enabling him to fling up to 9 objects of up to 18 stone each, or a single object of up to (9 x 9 x 2) 162 stone. He opts for the latter, and flings the light catapult onto its own four crew members. He makes a successful attack throw against one of the crew’s AC. That crew member takes 8d6 damage (and dies!). The other three crew members, all within 15’, must save v. Blast or suffer 8d6 damage each. The light catapult itself takes 8d6/5 shp, enough to destroy it.

| Creature / Object’s Weight |	Damage Dealt
| :------------------------- | :------------
| Up to 4 stone (80lb)	| 1d6
| 4 stone to 8 stone (81-160lb)	| 2d6
| 8 stone to 15 stone (160-300lb)	| 3d6 (5’ radius)
| 15 stone to 30 stone (301-600lb)	| 4d6 (10’ radius)
| 30 stone to 60 stone (601-1,200lb)	| 5d6 (15’ radius)
| 60 stone to 120 stone (1,200-2,400lb	| 6d6 (15’ radius)
| 120 stone to 240 stone (2,400-4,800lb)	| 8d6 (15’ radius)
| 240 stone to 392 stone (4,800-7,840lb)	| 10d6 (20’ radius)

#### Forest Enchantment
| Range:| 0’
|:
| Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:| special
This spell is a favorite of elven spellsingers and Nobiran wizards of nature, who commonly cast it in the vicinity of their fastnesses and towers. When cast, it charms all of the plants in a 240’ radius around the caster. Thereafter the caster, and any characters he “introduces” to the plants as friends, can move among the normal plants in the area of effect free from intentional or accidental harm – rose bushes will twist so that their thorns do not pierce him, poisonous ivy will not leak oil onto him, tree branches and roots will shift slightly so as not to trip him, and so on. In addition, the charmed plants will be hostile to enemies of the caster who intrude upon the area; trespassers will find that thorns bite them, branches and roots entangle them, and leaves whistle where they pass. In game terms, the caster and his allies gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls and improved movement multipliers in the area of effect, while enemies suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls and worsened movement multipliers in the area of effect.

Normal plants receive no saving throw when the spell is cast, but each season thereafter they receive a saving throw to break the spell; the Judge should roll once for all normal plants in the area of effect as if they were a 1 HD monster. If the caster does severe damage to the plants in the area of effect (such as clear cutting the trees), the spell immediately ends, but gathering fallen wood, picking fruit and flowers, trimming leaves, and similar gardening does not end the forest enchantment.

The spell can also affect any plant monsters that happen to be within the area of effect, but these are allowed a save versus Spells to resist if of 2 HD or greater. Once in effect, the charm lasts until removed by a dispel magic spell or until the affected plant monster makes a successful saving throw versus Spells. The charmed plant monster receives a saving throw to break the spell each day if it has 7+1 HD or more, every week if it has 5-6 HD, and every month if it has 4 HD or fewer. This spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected plants.

#### Forgetfulness
|Range:| 15’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:| special
This spell induces forgetfulness in one or more living creatures within range. Up to 3d6 HD of living creatures of up to 4 HD each can be affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Affected creatures lose all memory of the preceding 30 rounds (5 minutes) before the spell was cast and form no memories of anything that happens during the subsequent 30 rounds (5 minutes) after the spell was cast. While under the influence of the spell, the affected creatures are passive and distracted, as if lost in thought or day dreaming. If attacked, they will defend themselves, but otherwise they will not interfere with the activities of other creatures. When the spell ends, the creatures are not aware of having been affected; they simply feel as if they have come out of a day dream or lapse in attention. Memories lost to this spell can return to the creature if the effect is dispelled or if the creature succeeds on a subsequent saving throw versus Spells. An affected creature receives a saving throw to recover its memories after a day has passed if it has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, after a week if its Intelligence is 9-12, or after a month it its Intelligence is 8 or less.

EXAMPLE: Arwen, an elven spellsinger, has infiltrated into the Temple of Dirgion in order to steal the Talisman of the Fiery Eye. She disguises herself with the grey robes of a priestess of Dirgion and enters the Temple. In the reliquary, she is confronted by a trio of bugbear guards, Borgat, Shigor, and Nassim. The bugbears attack her because she fails to offer the correct password. On her initiative, Arwen casts forgetfulness on the bugbears. She throws 3d6 to determine the HD of creatures she can target, and rolls a 13 – more than enough to affect all three bugbears. The beastmen forget they saw her, and stand passively daydreaming as she rummages through the reliquary, finds the Talisman of the Fiery Eye, and departs. A month later, Borgat, Shigor, and Nassim receive saving throws versus Spells to recover their memories. Borgat makes his saving throw and remembers what happened. Shigor and Nassim fail their saves, and can’t corroborate his story. Borgat is executed as the likely culprit.
 
#### Frighten Beasts
|Range:| 60’
| :
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|Duration:| 30 rounds
This spell can frighten one or more animals (including giant animals) within range. Up to 6 HD of animals can be affected. Animals with the fewest HD are affected first. Affected animals become frightened. A frightened animal cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to bay, howl, or yip in fear). A frightened animal will run from the source of its fear at its full movement rate for the duration of the spell. If a frightened animal cannot flee, its cower in terror. An engaged animal that is frightened will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends. Intelligent animals may make a saving throw versus Spells to resist the spell.

#### Gentle Repose
|Range:| touch
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Black)
|Duration:| 1 day per level
This spell preserves the remains of a dead creature so they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead or animating it as a zombie. Days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against such time limits. (This spell also makes transporting a fallen comrade more pleasant!)

#### Guise Other
|Range:| touch
| :
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration: |1 day
This spell grants the caster the ability to alter a willing target’s shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control the target’s new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. The target’s equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw, guise other can allow the target to appear as a specific individual.

#### Guise Self
|	Range:| self
| :
|Eldritch| 4 (White)
|		Duration:| 1 day
This spell grants the caster the ability to alter his shape into that of any other humanoid creature. The caster can control his new shape’s physical qualities (such as height, weight, gender, hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of its kind. His equipment, if any, remains worn or held where possible, and otherwise melds into the new form. If used in conjunction with a successful Disguise proficiency throw, guise self can allow the caster to appear as a specific individual.  

#### Gusting Gale
|		Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (Grey)
|		Duration:| Concentration to maximum 1 round per level
This spell creates a strong blast of air that originates from the caster and affects all creatures in a line 10’ wide and 60’ long. Because the spell draws its power from natural air, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room.  The effect of the gusting gale depends on the size of the creatures.

Tiny creatures (the size of a house pet or smaller) are knocked down and rolled 1d4x10’, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10’. If flying, a tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10’ feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting. Small creatures, such as halflings or goblins, are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are knocked back 1d6x10’ feet. Man-sized creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are knocked back 1d6x5’ feet. Large creatures may move normally within a gusting gale. Creatures which make a successful saving throw versus Blast are not affected by the wind.

Missile attack throws within or through a gusting gale are at a -4 penalty, as are proficiency throws to hear noise. The force of the gust automatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly, with a 50% chance of being extinguished. A gusting gale will also do anything that a sudden blast of 50mph wind would be expected to do, such as fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings, create a spray of dust, or blow vapors out of range (Judge’s discretion).
 
#### Healing Circle
|Range:| 30’
| :
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|		Duration:| instantaneous
This spell immediately heals one or more creatures within 30’ of the caster. The healing circle can affect one creature, plus an additional two creatures per five additional caster levels after 1st (e.g. an 11th level caster can affect five creatures within his healing circle). All effected creatures instantly regains hit points as if each had rested for one day. The spell may also be used to cure paralysis in one, some, or all of the affected creatures, but does not then cure any points of damage. The spell will never increase a creature’s hit points beyond the normal amount.

#### Home Ward
|Range:| 15’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|		Duration:| special
The caster places a protective ward on a structure up to 20,000 cubic feet in size. (Larger structures can be protected by multiple wards.) Once placed, a home ward remains until either dispelled or triggered by a summoned creature entering the structure it wards. When the home ward is triggered, the summoned creature that triggered it must make a saving throw versus Spells. If the save fails, the creature is dispelled back to its home plane. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. In either case, the home ward vanishes. A home ward leaves no visible mark on the structure it protects, but its presence can be revealed by detect magic, true seeing, or similar spells.

#### Hypnotism
|Range:| 15’
|:
|Eldritch |1 (Grey)
|		Duration:| 1 round per level
By means of mesmerizing gestures and droning incantations, the caster can hypnotize 1d4 living creatures in range. Creatures with fewest HD are affected first. Affected creatures may resist the spell with a saving throw versus Spells. Hypnotized creatures can be given a one sentence suggestion, which they will carry out to the best of their ability. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. However, a target may be led to believe that an action is not harmful; for instance, a creature might be told to drink a poisonous potion by suggesting the potion is actually beneficial. Each hypnotized creature will continue carrying out the suggestion until the activity is complete or the duration expires, whichever comes first. Note that the caster must be able to speak the language of the creatures or otherwise communicate effectively in order to issue suggestions.

#### Ice Floe
|Range:| touch
|:
|Eldritch |1 (Grey)
|Duration:| 8 hours
This spell instantly freezes a portion of a body of water that the caster touches, creating a flat pack of ice that floats on the remaining water. The ice floe created by the spell may be up to 10’ long and 10’ wide and up to 1’ thick, for a total volume of up to 100 cubic feet. The ice floe’s length, width, and thickness cannot exceed the length, width, and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an ice floe, no matter how large the creature is.

As ice is less dense than water, the top of the ice floe will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A typical 1’ thick ice floe will stick up about 1.25” above the water. The ice floe can support up to 5lbs of creatures or objects per cubic foot while remaining afloat, but any additional weight will cause the ice floe to sink below the surface of the water. If the caster concentrates while touching the ice floe, he can magically move it across the water at an encounter movement rate of 20’ per turn.

The ice floe is only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 5 shp. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.

When an ice floe is created in above-freezing temperatures, it will melt after 8 hours. Dispel magic will instantly melt an ice floe in above-freezing temperatures. Otherwise when the spell expires or is dispelled, the caster loses the ability to magically move the ice floe, but it does not melt until temperatures rise. (That is to say, the ice doesn’t magically heat up!)

#### Ice Sheet		
|Range:| 30’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:| permanent
This spell instantly freezes a large volume of water, creating a thick sheet of ice that floats on the remaining water. The ice sheet created by the spell can be either 1”, 4”, 1’, or 10’ thick.

A 1” thick ice sheet can have a maximum surface area of 180,000 square feet (approximately 240’ radius), a 4” thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 45,000 square feet (approximately 120’ radius), a 1’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 15,000 square feet (approximately 70’ radius), and a 10’ thick sheet can have a maximum surface area of 1,500 square feet (approximately 20’ radius).

The ice sheet’s surface area and thickness cannot exceed the surface area and depth of the body of water from which it is created. It cannot be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, but it can be evoked over creatures under the water. The water inside a living creature cannot be turned into an ice sheet, no matter how large the creature is.

As ice is less dense than water, the top of the ice sheet will be about 10% higher than the surface of the water. A 1” thick ice sheet will be about 1/8” above the water, a 4” thick sheet will be about 3/8” above the water, a 1’ thick one will be about 1.25” above the water, and a 10’ thick one about 1’.

Creatures may safely move across the ice sheet at their encounter movement rate. Creatures moving across the sheet at their combat movement rate must make a proficiency throw of 2+ each round or fall prone. Creatures moving across the sheet at their running movement rate must make a proficiency throw each round with a target value equal to their encumbrance, or fall prone.

The ice sheet can support a maximum weight of 75,000 lbs across its entire surface. Any additional weight will cause the ice sheet to sink below the surface of the water.  In addition, heavy creatures may break through the ice beneath their feet. A 1” thick sheet can only support small creatures (less than 35 lbs). A 4” thick sheet can support man-sized creatures (up to 400 lbs). A 1’ thick sheet can support large creatures (up to 2,000 lbs.). A 10’ thick sheet can support gigantic creatures (up to 32,000 lbs). For each size category by which a creature exceeds the ice sheet’s limit, the ice has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking beneath their feet. When this occurs, the creature falls into the water. Creatures in icy water also suffer 1 point of cold damage per round and must make a swimming check or begin drowning (see ACKS p. XX). If the creature passes the swimming check, it may pull itself back onto the safety of the ice on its initiative (although the ice may break again).

EXAMPLE: Quintus is being pursued by an ogre. His escape is blocked by a 500’ wide river. He casts ice sheet and creates a 90’ wide, 500’ long, 4” bridge of ice across the river. As a man-sized creature, Quintus is able to safely cross the sheet. The ogre is a large-sized creature, however, and may break through the 4” thick ice. It is one size category larger than the 4” sheet’s limit, so it has a 1 in 6 chance each round of breaking through. Assuming the ogre crosses at its combat movement rate of 30’ per round, it will require 17 rounds to get across the ice….

The ice sheet is only as resilient as any other large block of frozen water. It counts as a structure with AC 2 and 1 shp per 20 cubic foot area. Man-sized creatures, large creatures, and light ballista cannot deal damage to the ice floe. Huge creatures, non-magical fire, and magic can deal 1/5th damage. Artillery, gigantic creatures, and magical fire can deal full damage.

Once created an ice sheet is permanent until dispelled.  

#### Ice Storm
|Range:| 240’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|		Duration:| 1 round
This spell conjures a 20’ diameter storm of freezing, razor-sharp hail that rains down from the heavens onto the target location. Any creatures or objects that begin their initiative in, or enter, the ice storm suffer 1d4 points of cold damage per caster level, or half that amount with a successful saving throw versus Blast. Any movement through the ice storm’s area of effect is at half normal rate.

If this spell is cast indoors or underground, the ice storm will strike the ceiling or surface above the desired area of effect. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the ice storm may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

#### Illumination*
|	Range:|	120'
|:
|Eldritch| 1
|Duration:|	6 turns plus 1 turn per level
This spell creates a spherical region of light around the target location or object. The illumination extends out to 30’ with the luminosity of torchlight, and sheds dim light for an additional 30’ beyond that. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.

Reversed, illumination becomes tenebrosity, creating a tenebrous area of darkness. The tenebrosity is as dark as a moonless night out to 30’ and as dark as a moonlit night for an additional 30’ beyond that. The tenebrosity also blocks out infravision and negates mundane light sources out to 30’.

Sometimes the effects of illumination and tenebrosity may come into conflict. For instance, an illuminated object might be carried into a tenebrous area, or a tenebrosity spell might be cast in an illuminated area. In either case, the level of the respective spellcasters determines the result. If the caster of illumination is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of tenebrosity, then the tenebrosity is extinguished. If the caster of tenebrosity is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of illumination, then the illumination is extinguished. In any other case, both spells are extinguished, restoring the existing ambient light level.  

#### Illumination, Continual*
|	Range:|	360'
|:
|Eldritch |2
|	Duration:|	special
This spell creates a spherical region of bright light around a target location or object. The continual illumination extends out to 30' with the luminosity of full daylight, an additional 30’ more with the luminosity of torchlight, and sheds dim light for an additional 30’ beyond that.. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.

Reversed, continual illumination becomes continual tenebrosity, creating a tenebrous area of pitch darkness.  The continual tenebrosity is pitch dark out to 30’, as dark as a moonless night for another 30’, and as dark as a moonlit night for an additional 30’ beyond that. The darkness blocks out infravision and negates mundane light sources out to 60’.

If an illuminated object enters the area of effect of continual tenebrosity, or a tenebrous object enters the area of effect of continual illumination, the lesser spell is immediately extinguished.

Sometimes the effects of continual illumination and continual tenebrosity may come into conflict. If so, the level of the respective spellcasters determines the result. If the caster of continual illumination is 3 or more caster levels higher than the caster of continual tenebrosity, then the continual tenebrosity is suppressed within the tenebrous area. If the caster of continual tenebrosity is 3 or more caster levels higher, then the continual illumination is suppressed within the illuminated area. In any other case, both spells are suppressed, restoring the existing ambient light level.  

Continual illumination and continual tenebrosity are not permanent effects, but are instead effects that are indefinitely sustained by the caster without need for concentration. A caster may indefinitely sustain one continual illumination or continual tenebrosity spell per level of experience. A truly permanent effect requires a permanency ritual or magic item.

#### Illusory Interior
|	Range:|	10’ per level
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
|Duration:|	special
This spell creates an illusion of interior decorations and furnishings. The illusion is strictly visual and does not encompass outdoor environments or living creatures. The entirety of the illusory interior must be within range of the spell and fit within a 10’ cube. (Multiple castings of illusory interior can be used to cover larger areas.) Since the interior décor created by this spell will not smell, sound, or feel as it should, creatures that interact with the illusory interior receive a saving throw versus Spells to disbelieve it. An illusory interior lasts until the illusion is dispelled. Subject to these limitations, the spell is useful for, e.g., concealing a door with an illusory wall, hiding a pit beneath an illusory carpet, presenting mundane furnishings as luxurious works of art, disguising a pile of coins as a hay pile, and so on.

#### Immunity to Acid
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (White)
|Duration:|	1 turn
This abjuration grants a creature, including its carried and worn items, complete immunity to acid for the duration of the spell. Minor acid (such as a few drops from an alchemical accident) might not even be noticed by the character. More significant acid (such as the corrosive breath of a black dragon) causes mild discomfort but no damage.  

#### Immunity to Cold
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (White)
Duration:|	1 turn
This abjuration grants a creature, including its carried and worn items, complete immunity to cold and ice for the duration of the spell. Minor cold and ice (such as a exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) does not even cause discomfort, and might not even be noticed by the character. More significant cold and ice (such as the icy breath of a white dragon), causes mild discomfort but no damage.  

#### Immunity to Electricity
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (White)
|Duration:|	1 turn
This abjuration grants a creature, including its carried and worn items, complete immunity to electricity and shock for the duration of the spell. Minor electricity (such as static shock) might not even be noticed by the character. More significant electricity (such as a thunderbolt) causes mild discomfort but no damage.  

#### Immunity to Fire
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (White)
|Duration:|	1 turn
This abjuration grants a creature, including its carried and worn items, complete immunity to fire and heat for the duration of the spell. Minor fire or heat (such as exposure to normal flame) might not even be noticed by the character. More significant fire or heat (such as a pillar of flame) causes mild discomfort but no damage.  

#### Incite Madness		
|Range:| 60’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|Duration:| permanent
This spell can afflict a living creature in range with a terrible madness. The target creature must make a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target becomes insane.  The insane creature rolls 2d6 on the following table on its initiative number each round to determine its actions:

|2d6|	Behavior
|:
|2–5|	Attack the caster or allies with melee or ranged weapons (or move closer if attack is not possible).
|6–8|	Do nothing but babble incoherently.
|9–12|	Attack the creature’s own party, if any.

Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking the insane creature. Any insane creature who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative, as long as it is still confused when its initiative comes. An insane creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.

Insanity is permanent until the effects are extinguished with dispel, cure disease, or remove curse.

#### Inferno
|Range:| 150’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|Duration: |1 round per level
This spell conjures a terrible inferno from the Sphere of Elemental Fire itself. The inferno is 30’ in diameter and 10’ high and burns everything within. It deals 1d10 points of damage each round to creatures that begin their initiative in or enter its area of effect (no saving throw). The inferno also sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. On the caster’s initiative number each round, structures suffer 1 point of shp per 10’ square area in the inferno. The inferno will also melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. The inferno lasts until dispelled or the spell’s duration expires.

#### Inflict Lycanthropy
|Range:|	60'
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Black)
|	Duration:|	permanent
This spell can infect a living creature with the horrid disease of lycanthropy. The target may make a saving throw versus Spells to avoid the infection. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the creature has been infected and will permanently transform into a lycanthrope in 2d6 days. (Demi-humans and other creatures unable to become lycanthropes will simply die of the disease.) Prior to that time, the infection can be cured with cure disease but once the transformation has occurred nothing short of a miracle will suffice.

The caster of the spell may select the type of lycanthrope the target transforms into, choosing from wererat, wereboar, werewolf, weretiger, or werebear. Once the transformation takes hold, the creature will gain the physical characteristics, mental characteristics, and special abilities of that type of lycanthrope. However, the creature will have the same number of Hit Dice and hit points as it had in its original form.

#### Infuriate Beasts
|Range:| 60’
|:
|Eldritch |2 (Black)
|Duration:| 12  rounds
This spell can enrage one or more animals (including giant animals). It can affect up to 3d6 Hit Dice of animals of 4 or fewer Hit Dice, or one animal of more than 4 Hit Dice. Calculate creatures with less than 1 HD as having ½ HD, and creatures with a bonus to HD as having the flat amount. The caster may decide which individual creatures out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess Hit Dice of effect are ignored. Each affected animal must make a saving throw versus Spells. If only one animal is to be affected, then its saving throw is made with a -2 penalty. If the save succeeds, the animal resists the spell. If the save fails, the animal becomes infuriated.

Each round, an infuriated animal will attack any creatures it can detect. It will prioritize attacking whichever creature has most recently damaged it, but otherwise will attack the closest target. If the animal has no eligible targets, it will wait motionless in seething fury until a target presents itself. An infuriated animal gains a +2 bonus to its attack throws but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC due to its mindless rage. It cannot talk or retreat. It is immune to fear and ignores morale. The animal remains infuriated until the spell ends or the effect is dispelled. However, if an infuriated female animal ever finds itself about to attack its own young, the animal may immediately make an additional saving throw at +5, with a successful save ending the effect.

#### Infuriate Crowd
|Range:| 60’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Black)
|Duration:| 12  rounds
This spell can enrage a crowd of living creatures. Up to 3d6 Hit Dice of living creatures of up to 4 HD each can be affected.  Calculate creatures with less than 1 HD as having ½ HD, and creatures with a bonus to HD as having the flat amount. The caster may decide which individual creatures out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess Hit Dice of effect are ignored. Each affected creature must make a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the save fails, the creature becomes infuriated. The effects on infuriated creatures are identical to those for infuriate person.

#### Infuriate Person		
|Range:| 60’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|Duration:| 12  rounds
This spell can enrage a humanoid creature within range. Humanoid creatures include bugbears, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, hobgoblins, kobolds, lizardmen, men, mermen, morlocks, neanderthals, naiads, ogres, pixies, sprites, and troglodytes, and other man-like creatures no larger than an ogre and possessing 4+1 or fewer Hit Dice. Humans and demi-humans may be affected regardless of character level. The target creature must make a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the save fails, the creature become infuriated.
 
Each round, an infuriated creature will attack any creatures it can detect. It will prioritize attacking whichever creature has most recently damaged it, but otherwise will attack the closest target. If the creature has no eligible targets, it will wait motionless in seething fury until a target presents itself. An infuriated creature gains a +2 bonus to its attack throws but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC due to its mindless rage. It cannot talk, retreat, or use spells or spell-like magic items. It is immune to fear and ignores morale. The creature remains infuriated until the spell ends or the effect is dispelled. However, if an infuriated creature ever finds itself about to attack its own spouse or child, the creature may immediately make an additional saving throw at +5, with a successful save ending the effect.

#### Inspire Awe*
|Range:| self
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (White)|
|Duration:| 30 rounds
This spell can inspire awe and dread in the hearts of the wicked. The means by which this occurs will depend on the caster’s spell signature. All “evil” creatures within 15’ of the caster must make a saving throw versus Spells. Creatures that successfully save are not affected. Creatures that fail the save are frightened. A frightened creature will run from the source of its fear at its full movement rate until the duration expires. If a frightened creature cannot flee, its cower in terror. An engaged creature that is frightened will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the duration expires. For purposes of this spell, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment.

The reverse of this spell, inspire horror, can cause fear and terror in the hearts of the kind, targeting good creatures rather than evil. For purposes of this spell, good creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently good creatures such as lammasu and summoned creatures of Lawful alignment.

#### Iron Maiden
|Range:| 90’
|:
|Eldritch |4 (Black)
|Duration:| special
This spell creates an invisible crushing vise around the entire body of the target creature. The target must make a saving throw versus Death. If the target’s saving throw succeeds, it breaks out of the iron maiden; it suffers 1d6 points of damage but the spell ends. If the target’s saving throw fails, the target is imprisoned by the iron maiden. It suffers 1d12 points of damage and is held helpless by the spell.

When helpless, a creature cannot attack, cast spells, or move. A helpless creature gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). A helpless creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against helpless creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the helpless creature. The helpless creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against helpless creatures automatically hit if the If the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the helpless creature. If the attacker is not engaged, and his attack is capable of damaging the helpless creature, then the helpless creature may be automatically slain. The attacker may not cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the helpless creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

When the caster’s next initiative number comes up, if the caster maintains concentration on the spell, then the imprisoned target must make another saving throw. On a successful save, the target breaks out (suffering 1d6 points damage) and ends the spell. On a failed save, the target continues to be imprisoned (suffering 1d12 points of damage and remaining helpless). The iron maiden lasts until dispelled, the caster stops concentrating upon it, or the target makes a successful saving throw and breaks out. 

#### Kindle Flame*
|Range:| 15’
|:
|Eldritch |1 (Grey)
|Duration:| instantaneous
By means of this spell, the caster can cause one or more readily flammable objects within range to burst into flame, even if the object or objects are wet. Readily flammable objects include bits of kindling, sticks of wood, clothing, hair, and cloth, but not flesh. All of the affected objects must be within a single 5’ diameter sphere. The caster can select which objects within the spell’s area of effect are ignited. In most cases this spell is used to light campfires in adverse weather, etc. If the spell is used to attack (to set a foe’s clothes on fire, for example), the target receives a saving throw versus Blast to avoid the effect. If it fails, the target suffers 1d8 points of damage each round until the flames go out. It takes one full round of rolling on the ground or being immersed in water to extinguish the flames. Unless the object ignited is quite large, the flames burn out naturally in 1d4+1 rounds.

The reverse of this spell, Quench Flame, instantly extinguishes the fire on one or more objects within range. All of the affected objects must be within a single 5’ diameter sphere.

#### Lay of the Land
|Range:|	3 miles
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration:|	concentration
This spell can magically reveal the existence of lairs within 3 miles (i.e. within the area of a 6-mile hex). The Judge should make a searching throw on behalf of the caster after three turns (30 minutes) of concentration. The target value for the throw is 4+, or 2+ if either the caster or his familiar has Land Surveying proficiency. If the throw fails, the spell immediately ends. If the throw succeeds, the caster learns the direction and approximate distance to the nearest unrevealed lair and can continue searching with the spell for other lairs. The throw automatically fails if there are no lairs in range, or if all lairs within range have been revealed by the spell. Because the roll is made in secret by the Judge, the caster cannot be certain whether the spell has ended because of chance or because there are no more lairs to find.

#### Locate Distant Object
|Range:|	1,200 miles
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|Duration:|	concentration
This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to a well-known or clearly visualized object, even over vast ranges (up to 1,200 miles or 50 24-mile hexes). He can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.

#### Locate Haunting
|Range:|	12 miles
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|	Duration:|	concentration
This spell allows the caster to sense the direction and approximate distance to the nearest undead creatures within 12 miles (i.e. within the area of a 24-mile hex). The caster can search for undead in general, in which case the spell will reveal the type of, as well as direction and distance to, the nearest undead of any sort. Alternatively, the caster can locate a particular undead creature (e.g. “the mummy Amon-Hotep”) that he either can identify by its true name or has physically encountered in the past. Locate haunting is not blocked by earth, stone, or wood, but even a thin sheet of lead or gold will obscure an undead creature from detection by this spell.

#### Mirage
|Range:|	240’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:|	special
This spell makes a fortified structure or piece of terrain appear as something else (e.g. a tower into a hill, a swamp into a lake, etc.) The entire terrain feature must be within range of the spell. This spell requires a full turn to cast. The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells exactly like its illusionary form. A save versus Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so. The mirage lasts until the illusion is dispelled. Mirage is frequently used by spellcasters to conceal their sanctums, and by elf-lords to hide their fastnesses.
 
#### Necromantic Invulnerability
|Range:|	caster
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:| 1 hour per level
This spell makes the character preternaturally difficult to kill. Suffused with necromantic energies, the caster could have his lung pierced, his throat cut, his arms cut off, or his skull bashed in, and still not die!  In game terms, anytime the caster is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the caster gets to immediately roll 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table. Apply the usual modifiers for Hit Points and Constitution, but instead of the modifiers for Treatment and Timing applies his caster level as a bonus. Record the result of any permanent wounds as usual. However, regardless of any permanent wound, the caster is then immediately restored to 1 hp without need for bed rest. A character protected by necromantic invulnerability can only be actually killed if he is slain while helpless by an unengaged combatant, or if he is disintegrated or slain by death magic.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses is an 11th level occultist with 31 hp and CON 11. He casts necromantic invulnerability on himself. A few hours later, he is caught in a 38-hp thunderbolt casts by his rival, Balbus, and reduced to -7 hp. Ra-Ramses immediately rolls 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table. His d20 roll is a lowly 2 but his d6 roll is a 5. There is no modifier from his CON of 11. There is a -2 penalty because his hp are at a negative value greater than ¼ but less than ½ his maximum hp. In lieu of any Treatment or Timing modifiers, he adds a bonus equal to his caster level, or +11. His final d20 result is therefore (2-2+11) or 11. A result of 11, 2 on the Mortal Wounds table means that Ra-Ramses has had an eye damaged. However, he is not critically wounded nor does he need one week’s bed rest; instead he immediately is restored to 1 hp. Balbus watches in horror as Ra-Ramses sits up and brushes himself off, the only apparent effect of the lightning blast being a filmy cataract on one eye.

#### Noiselessness		
|Range:|	self
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (White)
|Duration:| concentration plus 3 rounds
This spell creates a sphere of complete silence with a 10' radius around the caster. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell lasts for as long as the caster concentrates plus 3 additional rounds thereafter. The spellcaster can end it earlier if desired simply by speaking. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.

#### Noxious Cloud
|Range:| 30’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
|Duration:| 1 round per level
This spell creates a billowing mass of foul-smelling vapors to arise within 30’. Because the spell draws its power from natural miasmas, it can only be cast outdoors or in a ventilated room. The noxious cloud is 20’ x 20’ x 20’ in size and blocks line of sight into or through it. Any creature that starts its initiative number in or enters the noxious cloud must make a successful saving throw versus Poison or become nauseated. Nauseated creatures cannot attack, cast spells, or take any other action except to move out of the cloud. The nauseated condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after exiting it. Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in or re-enters the cloud must continue to save each round.

#### Paralyze
|Range:|	60’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
|Duration:| 1 round per level
This spell can paralyze up to 3d6 HD of living creatures within range. Creatures with fewer HD are affected first. Each affected creature may make a saving throw versus Paralysis to resist the effect. Those that fail the saving throw are paralyzed until the spell is dispelled or its duration expires. A paralyzed creature cannot attack, cast spells, or move. A paralyzed creature gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). A paralyzed creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against paralyzed creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the paralyzed creature. The paralyzed creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against paralyzed creatures automatically hit if the If the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the paralyzed creature. If the attacker is not engaged, and his attack is capable of damaging the paralyzed creature, then the paralyzed creature may be automatically slain. The attacker may not cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the paralyzed creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

#### Pillar of Fire		
|Range:| 150’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:| instantaneous

This spell conjures a 40’ high and 20’ diameter column of eldritch fire that roars downward from the heavens onto the target location. The pillar of fire deals 5d8 points of damage to all creatures within its area of effect. Creatures who make a successful saving throw versus Blast suffer half damage.

If this spell is cast indoors or underground, the pillar of fire will strike the ceiling or surface above the desired area of effect. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the pillar may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

#### Phoenix Aura		
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration: |1 round per level or special

This spell surrounds the caster with an aura of elemental fire to a 5’ radius. The caster is not harmed by the phoenix aura itself, but any creatures or objects that begin their initiative in or enter the recipient’s aura suffer 1d6 points of fire damage. The phoenix aura lasts for one round per level of the caster or until the caster triggers an explosion (see below), whichever comes first.  

On its initiative, in lieu of moving and attacking, the caster can amplify the phoenix aura into an explosion that deals 4d6 points of fire plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage per round left in the spell’s duration. The explosion affects all creatures within 10’ of the caster when he triggers it, but does not harm the caster. Affected creatures may make a saving throw versus Blast to reduce damage by half.

#### Prophetic Dream
|Range:|	self
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|	Duration:|	special
This spell can provide the caster with a short piece of meaningful and important information. The caster can designate a specific character, settlement, domain, realm, or object about which he would like information, or open himself to whatever the gods find most important. The information will be relayed in the form of a prophetic dream the next time the caster sleeps. The information provided by a prophetic dream is always true, but because it comes in the form of a dream it may be misunderstood due to cryptic symbolism and esoteric meaning. If the caster misunderstands the prophetic dream, or doesn’t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. A character may cast this spell no more than once per week.

#### Protection from Blast
|Range:| self
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration:| concentration
This potent spell grants invulnerability to any spells which deal damage or detrimental effects to individual targets or over areas of effect through evoking or manipulating a medium such as eldritch force, fire, or toxic gas. The protection extends to the caster himself and all those within 5’ of him and continues for as long as the caster maintains concentration upon the spell.
Protection from Blast, Sustained	Range: self
Eldritch 6 (White)			Duration: 2 turns
This spell functions exactly as protection from blast, but with a duration of 2 turns. The barrier will move with the caster, who does not need to concentrate to maintain its protection.
 
#### Rain of Vitriol
|Range:| 180’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
|Duration:| 1 round
This spell can only be cast outdoors under a rainstorm. When the spell is cast, the caster designates a point within range. All rain within a 10’ radius of the point is transformed into vitriol (sulfuric acid). Any creatures that begin their initiative in, or enter, the rain of vitriol must make a saving throw versus Blast.

Creatures that fail the saving throw are soaked with vitriol. They suffer 3d4 points of acid damage immediately, another 2d4 points of acid damage on their next initiative, and another 1d4 points of damage on their subsequent initiative. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw are only splashed with vitriol. They suffer 2d4 points of acid damage immediately and another 1d4 points of acid damage on their next initiative.  If a creature takes an action in lieu of attacking to clean off the acid, it can reduce the amount of damage it or any ally suffers on subsequent rounds by 1d4 points. If a creature moves to completely immerse itself in water (mere rain is not sufficient), it can reduce the damage it suffers on subsequent rounds to 0.

Metal and stone objects suffer minor corrosion from rain of vitriol but the effect is merely cosmetic. Constructs or creatures made of metal and stone cannot be affected by the spell.

#### Reflesh of the Bones
|Range:| touch
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:| permanent
The caster touches the skeleton of a dead creature and infuses it with necromantic energy, causing new flesh, muscle, organs, and tissue to instantly regenerate. The result is a new creature of the same type, and with the same physical characteristics, as the dead one. Reflesh of the bones does not return the mind or soul of the original dead creature to the body, and if reflesh of the bones is cast on the skeleton of a sapient adult creature, the refleshed creature will be an empty-headed brute (INT 3, WIS 3, CHA 3). The spell has no effect on living or undead creatures, nor on constructs or inanimate objects.

#### Resist Acid
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (White)
|	Duration:|	6 turns
This abjuration grants a creature temporary and partial immunity to acid. Minor acid (such as a few drops from an alchemical accident) is ignored by the subject creature. Against more significant acid (such as the breath of a Black Dragon), the subject creature gains a bonus of +2 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by -1 point per die of damage rolled. Any acid attacks will still inflict at least 1 point of damage per die rolled, however.

#### Resist Electricity
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (White)
|Duration:|	6 turns
This abjuration grants a creature temporary and partial immunity to electricity. Minor electricity (such as static shock) is ignored by the subject creature. Against more significant electricity (such as a thunderbolt), the subject creature gains a bonus of +2 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by -1 point per die of damage rolled. Any electrical attacks will still inflict at least 1 point of damage per die rolled, however.

#### Restore Semblance of Life
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
This spell imbues necromantic energies into a recently-deceased creature, restoring it to a semblance of life. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than two days at 7th level, and four days are added per level above 7. For example, a 9th level caster can restore semblance of life to a creature that has been dead for 10 days. However, this spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age, lost its head, or had its body cremated.

Creatures restored to semblance of life do not need bed rest, as the infusion of necromantic energies restores them to immediate vigor. However, the spell has no effect on any permanent wounds the creature may suffer from, so lost limbs, disfiguring scars, or other injuries remain in effect. Many creatures restored to a semblance of life thus awaken as cripples. Worse is the spell’s effect on the subject’s very soul: Any creature restored to a semblance of life will automatically suffer two side effects on the Tampering with Mortality table in ACKS, one from Row 1-5 (“Great Cost”) and one from Row 11-15 (“Intense”). Roll 1d6 for each. In addition, the subject is sterile, having no genuine vitality to pass on.

EXAMPLE: Athelstan suffers a mortal wound, his lips and tongue mangled by the mace of an ogre, and he expires shortly thereafter. His comrade Balbus, now a 14th level ecclesiastic, finds the dead warrior two weeks days later. In a state of mad grief, Balbus foolishly decides to restore semblance of life on his slain friend. As a 14th level caster, Balbus is able to restore a creature dead for up to 30 days, so the foul state of Athelstan’s corpse is no obstacle. Athelstan is restored, but he must roll twice on the Tampering with Mortality table. On Row 1-5, Athelstan rolls a 1 – his heart beats and his blood flows, but life is not the same; he loses 1d4 points of CON and WIS. On Row 11-15, Athelstan rolls a 2 – he is disturbed by what he saw on the other side and mumbles constantly. “Eh Ohaoo…Eh ohaoo,” the warrior mutters through his mangled lips and tongue. The horror.

#### Ring of Fire
|Range:| 0’
| :
|Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
|Duration:| 1 turn
This spell surrounds the caster with a protective circle of immobile, opaque, flame. The ring of fire is 4’ high and 1” thick, and encircles the caster at a radius of 5’ to 20’ (selected when the spell is cast). Because of its low height, the ring of fire does not block line of sight, and creatures capable of flight or high jumping can easily clear it. Creatures outside the ring that begin their initiative within 5’ of its outer edge or who move within 5’ of its outer edge on their initiative, suffer 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that pass through the ring of fire suffer an additional 2d6 points of fire damage. The ring deals double damage to undead creatures or creatures who use cold or are accustomed to cold. The ring may be evoked so that it appears where objects or creatures already are. Creatures who make a successful saving throw versus Blast are able to dive into or out of the ring (their choice) without being harmed; objects such as furniture in the circumference of the ring will be ignited. However, if the ring is evoked so that parts of its circumference overlaps with a noncombustible barrier (such as a stone wall), that part of the ring will simply not manifest, resulting in an incomplete circle. The ring of fire lasts until the caster dismisses it (as an action in lieu of moving), it is dispelled, or 1 turn elapses.

#### Safe Travels
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (White)
|Duration:| Special

This spell protects a traveler, guiding him to his destination safe and unhindered. The subject of the spell gains a +2 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the subject of the spell receives a +3 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. The duration of the spell extends for the length of the traveler’s journey, to a maximum duration of one month.

#### Scouring Zephyr
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch |5 (Grey)		
|Duration: |instantaneous
This spell summons up a scouring zephyr from the skies. Because the spell draws its power from atmospheric winds, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. The scouring zephyr sweeps from the caster to affect all creatures in a cone 60’ long and 10’ wide at its terminus. Any creatures within the cone will suffer 7d4 points of damage from abrasion and debris whipped up by the zephyr. A successful saving throw versus Blast reduces damage to half.

Creatures subjected to the scouring zephyr that fail their saving throw suffer additional effects, depending on their size. Tiny creatures (the size of a house pet or smaller) are knocked down and rolled 1d4x10’, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10’. If flying, a tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10’ feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting. Small creatures, such as halflings or goblins, are knocked prone by the force of the wind, and if flying are knocked back 1d6x10’ feet. Man-sized creatures are unaffected if on foot, but are knocked back 1d6x5’ feet if flying. Large creatures move normally despite a scouring zephyr.  
 
In addition, the force of the scouring zephyr automatically extinguishes any candles, torches, or other unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly, with a 50% chance of being extinguished. A scouring zephyr will also do anything that a sudden blast of 50mph wind would be expected to do, such as fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings, create a spray of dust, or blow vapors out of range (Judge’s discretion).

#### Shatter Blade
|	Range:| 30’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Grey)
|		Duration:| instantaneous
By means of this spell, the caster destroys a single weapon, causing its blade to shatter or melt away into smoke. If the weapon is held by a creature, the wielder may make a saving throw versus Death to resist the effect, adding the weapon’s magic bonus (if any) to the die roll. In any case, the spell causes no harm to the creature holding the weapon (except for depriving him of it).

A caster of 6th level or higher may shatter two weapons, while a caster of 11th level of higher may shatter three weapons. The weapons may be held by the same creature or by different creatures within range. Each weapon saves separately in any case.

#### Shared Dream
|Range:| 500 miles
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (White)
|		Duration:| 1 round per level
This spell permits the caster to communicate with a target character within range by means of a shared dream. The caster must be able to identify the target – referencing a correct name (“Audarius Tarkaun”), unique title (“the Tarkaun of Aura”), or unique possession (“the owner of the Sword of the Dawn”) will suffice. The caster then spends 10 minutes (1 turn) casting the spell, during which time he enters a state of lucid dreaming. The caster is unaware of his surroundings and completely helpless while in this dream state.

If the target is asleep when the caster completes the spellcasting, the caster and the target begin to share a lucid dream. For the duration of the spell, the caster and the target can converse in this shared dream. The caster can also shape the environment of the shared dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images, in order to communicate to the target. The target recalls the shared dream perfectly upon waking.

If the target is awake when the caster completes the spellcasting, the caster knows it, and can either end his dream-state (and the spell) or can remain in the dream state while waiting for the target to fall asleep, at which point the shared dream begins.

#### Shrieking Skull
|Range:| 30’
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (black)
|Duration:| 1 turn
This spell allows the caster to animate the skull of a single human or humanoid and command it to fly and attack at his will. The skull attacks with a bite or a fearful shriek. Both bite and shriek induce fear as per the spell cause fear (a saving throw versus Spells negates), the reverse of the spell remove fear, but the shriek affects all living creatures within 10’. When the shriek is used, or at the end of the spell’s duration (whichever comes first), the skull crumbles to the floor. The skull cannot be turned.

Shrieking Skull: MV 20' flying, AC 9, HD 4+4, #AT 1, DG 1d6 + fear or shriek, SV C5, ML +3, AL C

#### Shrouding Fog
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
|Duration: 1 turn per level
When this spell is cast, a misty vapor thickens around the spellcaster, forming a billowing cloud 10’ high, and 10’ in diameter per level of the caster. Because the spell draws its power from natural air, it can only be cast outdoors or in a well-ventilated room. The shrouding fog is harmless, but blocks line of sight for most creatures. The caster, and any creatures able to see invisible, can see dimly through shrouding fog but all others within the cloud are effectively blind.

#### Slag Armor
|Range:| 90’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Grey)
|Duration:| concentration

The spell can raise the temperature of metal armor, causing it to melt into slag and – if the armor is being worn - inflicting horrible burns on its wearer. The armor may make a saving throw versus Blast to resist the effect, adding its magic bonus (if any) to the throw. If the armor is worn by a creature, use the creature’s saving throw; otherwise, the armor saves as a normal man. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the armor’s class is reduced by 1 point. A wearer suffers 1d6 points of fire damage and becomes unable to take any action besides shedding the armor. It takes one round per stone of encumbrance to shed armor.

When the caster’s next initiative number comes up, if the caster maintains concentration on the spell, then the armor continues to melt. The armor must make another saving throw, as above. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the armor continues to melt (losing 1 point of AC) and any wearer continues to be burned (suffering 1d6 points of damage and remaining unable to take any action except shed the armor). If the armor is reduced to AC 0 (including magic bonuses), it is destroyed.

If slag armor is cast on a living iron statue, iron golem, or similar creature constructed of metal, it reduces the target’s armor class by 1 and deals 1d6 points of damage per round it is in effect. Slag armor lasts until the spell is dispelled, the armor is destroyed, the caster stops concentrating upon it, or the target makes a successful saving throw.

#### Slicing Blow
|Range:|	30’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
This spell allows the caster to necromantically inflict a vicious cut on a target creature within range. The spellcaster must make a successful attack throw against the creature. If he hits, the slicing blow deals 1d10 points of damage with no saving throw.

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th level), the caster gains the ability to inflict an additional slicing blow. The caster’s slicing blows can all strike at one target or can strike at different targets, as desired; roll a separate attack throw for each slicing blow.

#### Sling Stone
|Range:| 180’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Grey)
|Duration:| instantaneous
By means of this spell, the caster magically slings one or more small objects at targets within range. The caster can sling up to one object per level of experience. The objects scan be slung at one target or distributed across several targets, as desired. The spellcaster must make a successful attack throw with each object. Each object that successfully hits deals 1d4 points of damage to its target.

To be slung by this spell, an object must be either in the caster’s hands or lying on the ground within 5’; must be made of clay, stone, or metal; and must weigh no more than 8 ounces. Most casters will carry a pouch of sling stones or bullets for use with this spell, but if necessary, a caster may resort to slinging objects that are littering the ground nearby. The Judge may randomly determine how many eligible objects are nearby based on the caster’s environment by rolling on the adjoining table.

| Environment |	No. of Objects
|:
| Room, Rubbled	| 2d10
| Room, Cluttered	| 1d10
| Room, Sparse	| 1d6
| Room, Empty	| 1d6-3
| Barren/Desert/Mountains	| 1d10
| Hills/Jungle/Scrub/Woods	| 1d6
| Clear/Grass/Swamp	| 1d3

#### Slumber
|Range:| 60'
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Grey)
|Duration:| 4d4 turns
With a slumber spell, the caster may attempt to put living creatures into a magical sleep. The caster may target up to 1d4 living creatures of up to 4 HD each. Creatures with 4+1 HD or more cannot be affected at all. All creatures to be affected must be visible and within range of the spell. All targets receive a saving throw v. Paralysis to avoid the effect.
 
Slumbering creatures are helpless, and cannot attack, cast spells, move, see, hear, or speak. A slumbering creature gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). A slumbering creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against slumbering creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs it. The slumbering creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against slumbering creatures automatically hit if the If the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the slumbering creature. If the attacker is not engaged, and his attack is capable of damaging the slumbering creature, then the slumbering creature may be automatically slain. The attacker may not cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the slumbering creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

Attacking, damaging, or moving a slumbering creature awakens it, but normal noise does not. Slumber does not affect creatures that are already unconscious or undead, constructs, oozes, and other creatures that do not rest.

#### Sorcerous Blast
|Range:|	150'
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Black)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
The caster directs a sorcerous bolt towards a point of the caster’s choice within range, where it explodes in a 20’ diameter blast of power. Each creature or object in the area of effect suffers 5d6 points of damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful saving throw versus Blast.

To select the point of detonation, the caster points a finger in the desired direction while mentally determining the range and elevation. If the sorcerous blast’s path is blocked by a material body or solid barrier, it will detonate early. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the explosion may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume. If the caster attempts to guide a sorcerous blast through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow loop, he must make a successful missile attack throw (without range adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the blast strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

####Sorcerous Bolt
|Range:|	150'
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Black)
|	Duration:|	instantaneous
The caster hurls a bolt of sorcerous power at a creature or object within range. The bolt deals 5d6 points of damage to the target, or half as much if the target makes a successful saving throw versus Blast.

#### Soul Eating		
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:| 1 day
The caster can draw and devour the soul from a victim, temporarily gaining a fraction of the victim’s knowledge and vigor. The spell is usually cast on bound and helpless victims; if used in combat, it requires a successful melee attack throw to touch the victim. Once touched, the victim must make a saving throw versus Death.

Even if the saving throw succeeds, the victim is still slain, but his soul eludes the caster’s grasp. If the saving throw fails, the victim is slain and his soul is eaten by the caster. Victims whose souls are eaten cannot be restored to life by any means short of a miracle or wish. The caster immediately gains 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 hp per level of the victim. In addition, the caster learns some important knowledge possessed by the victim, either a specific set of facts that the caster was seeking or some random knowledge chosen by the Judge. The knowledge learned can be quite complex, equivalent to a single rank in a proficiency, a class power, a spell formula, or a language. The temporary hit points will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration, while the knowledge will fade as if it was a barely-remembered dream. Nothing prevents a caster from writing down the knowledge gained from this spell before it fades, however.

EXAMPLE: Ra-Ramses wishes to plumb the depths of the dungeon of his rival, Baldur the Black. Baldur’s dungeon is reputed to be a deadly maze filled with traps, secret doors, and foul guardians, so Ra-Ramses abducts Archimedian, the engineer who built the dungeon, and casts soul eating on him. Archimedian (a 5th level loremaster) fails his saving throw v. Death, so his soul is eaten by Ra-Ramses. Ra-Ramses gains 1d10 + 5 hp. The Judge decides that having complete knowledge of the layout and design of Baldur’s dungeon is equivalent to the Mapping proficiency, and thus within the purview of the spell. Ra-Ramses now has a day to exploit this knowledge, either by venturing into the dungeon immediately or by spending a day drafting maps.

While soul eating is in effect, the spellcaster is treated as an inherently evil summoned creature for purposes of detect evil and protection from evil effects. A dispel evil or dispel magic spell will strip the caster of his temporary proficiency and hit points unless he makes a successful saving throw versus Spells.

#### Spectral Legion
|Range:| 240 yards
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:| concentration
This spell was created for use by war-wizards on the field of battle. It creates an audiovisual illusion of a complete military unit of up to 120 man-sized creatures, 60 large (cavalry or ogre-sized) creatures, 20 huge creatures, 5 gigantic creatures, or 1 colossal creature. The unit can be of any type, equipped with any arms or armor desired, wearing whatever colors, insignia, and unit markings the caster wishes. It can appear fresh and well-ordered, or bloodied and demoralized, or anything in between.

Once the spectral legion is conjured, it can be moved anywhere within range at the same movement rate as an actual unit of its type. The spectral legion moves on the caster’s own initiative. The illusion is fully dynamic, so the unit will seem to march, trot, gallop, fly, or otherwise actually move, and as it does so its boots will seemingly kick up dust, its banners will seemingly wave in the breeze, and so on. The spectral legion will remain on the battlefield for as long as the caster maintains concentration. While concentrating, the caster can move at half speed, but cannot attack or cast other spells. If the caster loses concentration, or if the spectral legion is ever successfully attacked by an enemy hero or unit, it immediately vanishes. For purposes of such attacks, treat the spectral legion as an enemy unit with AC 0. Due to its amazing veracity, a spectral legion cannot be disbelieved.

#### Spellward
|Range:|	self
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (White)
|Duration:|	6 turns
This spell creates a defensive ward around the spellcaster. The spellward has a number of layers equal to the caster's level of experience. When the caster makes a saving throw against a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect, he can expend one or more layers of the spellward to gain a +1d4 bonus per layer to the saving throw. After the saving throw (if any) is resolved, the character can expend one or more layers of the spellward to reduce the damage by 1d4 points per layer. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the spellward, the character does not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit. If a spellwarded caster is subjected to a dispel magic spell, he can expend one or more layers from the ward to increase his effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to dispel his magic. Spellward expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made permanent through ritual magic, the spellward recharges two layers per turn.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, a 6th level caster, is in a magical duel! He had previously cast spellward, and as a 6th level caster his ward has six layers. He is in the middle of casting lightning bolt when his opponent strikes him with a fireball that deals 21 points of damage. Quintus expends one layer of the ward to gain a +1d4 bonus on the saving throw. His save then succeeds, halving the damage to 10 points. He then expends the last five layers of the ward to reduce the damage by 5d4 points. He rolls the dice and the result is a 12! The damage has been reduced to 0 or less, and his spell is not interrupted. On his initiative number, he blasts his opponent with lightning bolt!

#### Spellward Other
| Range:|	touch
|:
| Eldritch |4 (White)
| Duration:|	6 turns
This spell creates a defensive ward around the creature touched. The spellward has a number of layers equal to the caster's level of experience. When the subject makes a saving throw against a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect, he can expend one or more layers of the spellward to gain a +1d4 bonus per layer to the saving throw. After the saving throw (if any) is resolved, the character can expend one or more layers of the spellward to reduce the damage by 1d4 points per layer. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the spellward, the character does not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit. If a spellwarded caster is subjected to a dispel magic spell, he can expend one or more layers from the ward to increase his effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to dispel his magic. Spellward Other expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made permanent through ritual magic, the spellward recharges two layers per turn.

#### Spellwarded Zone
|Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|	Duration:|	6 turns
This spell creates a defensive ward that protects a 20’ diameter sphere. The spellward has a number of layers equal to the caster's level of experience. The spellward automatically triggers whenever a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect would affect the area. If a spell, elemental effect, or spell-like effect affects an area that is inclusive of the spellwarded zone, but also affects areas outside the zone, the spellward will trigger, but its protection only extends to its own area of effect.

EXAMPLE: Quintus, Marcus, Balbus, and Viktir are standing in a large amphitheater, 100’ in radius, the four of them strung out in a line 5’ apart. Quintus, now an 11th level caster, has cast spellwarded zone on a 20’ diameter sphere centered on himself. He, Marcus, and Balbus are all standing in the zone but Viktir is 5’ outside its perimeter. Ramses-Ra calls down a 14th level starfall with a 20’ diameter area of effect that strikes the area where Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus are standing. The spellward is triggered, but Viktir will not benefit from its protection.

If the triggering effect allows for a saving throw, one layer of the spellward will be automatically expended to provide a +1d4 bonus to the saving throw for the affected area and/or any creature(s) in the area.

EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra has brought down a 14th level starfall on Viktir, Balbus, and Marcus. It deals 50 points of damage! However, Balbus and Marcus are in a spellwarded zone with 11 layers. The spellward is triggered, and one of its layers is automatically expended to provides a +1d4 bonus to Balbus and Marcus’s saving throws. The die roll is a 3, so both Balbus and Marcus get a +3 bonus to their save. Balbus succeeds, but Marcus rolls badly and fails despite the bonus. Viktir, meanwhile, does not get the bonus, but he manages a lucky roll of 19 and succeeds anyway. The starfall will deal 50 points of damage to Marcus and 25 points to Balbus and Viktir.

If the triggering effect deals damage, one layer of the spellward will be automatically expended for every 5 points of damage the effect deals (ignore any reduction from saving throws), up to the maximum number of layers. Each layer expended reduces the damage by 1d4 points. If the damage is reduced to 0 or less by the spellward, then any creature(s) in the area are entirely unharmed, and do not suffer an interruption of concentration or other effects that may accrue upon being hit.

EXAMPLE: Ramses-Ra’s starfall is dealing 50 points of damage. Therefore (50/5) 10 layers of the spellward are automatically expended in order to reduce the damage by 10d4 points. The dice roll results in 30 points of damage reduction. Balbus, whose save succeeded, therefore takes no damage. Marcus, whose save failed, takes (50-30) 20 points of damage. Viktir, whose save succeeded, takes 25 points of damage because he is outside the spellwarded zone.

If the spellwarded zone is subjected to a dispel magic spell, it will expend one layer of the ward per two caster levels of the dispel in order to increase its effective caster level by 1d4 per layer, making it harder to dispel the zone. Spellward zone expires when all of the layers are expended, or after 6 turns, whichever comes first. If this spell is made permanent through ritual magic, the spellward recharges two layers per turn.

#### Spiritwalk
|Range:| self
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration:| 1 hour per level
The caster enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. Once a spiritwalk begins, it continues until the caster’s spirit returns to his body, to a maximum duration of 1 hour per level. A spiritwalking character can see and hear normally, move around at his normal movement rate, and pass through solid objects without difficulty. However, the spiritwalking character cannot see into, hear sounds from, or move through an area warded by an anti-magic shell or protection from evil spell or similar effect. The spiritwalking character is incorporeal and invisible, but can be detected with detect invisible or true seeing, harmed by spells and magic weapons if detected, and forced to return to his body with dispel evil. If the spiritwalking character’s body is destroyed, the character dies at the end of the spiritwalk. If the spiritwalking character’s spirit is destroyed, his body falls into a catatonic slumber that can only be lifted with restore life and limb, resurrection, miracle, or wish.
 
#### Starfall
|Range:| 240’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell calls down a falling star from the heavens to strike a point of the caster’s choice, where it explodes in a blossom of fire that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to every creature within a 20’ diameter sphere. Creatures in the area of effect who make a successful saving throw versus Blast suffer half damage. The explosion also sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze.

To select the point of impact, the caster points a finger in the desired direction while mentally determining the range and elevation. A glowing, red-hot meteoroid then streaks from the sky and descends to the desired point at the prescribed range. However, if the falling star’s path to its destination is blocked by a material body or solid barrier, it will detonate early. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the explosion may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

If the caster attempts to call down a starfall through a narrow passage, such as through an overhead murder hole or skylight, he must make a successful missile attack throw (without range adjustments) to hit the opening, or else the meteoroid strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

#### Strengthen the Unliving		
|Range:|	30’
|:
|Eldritch| 3 (Black)
Duration:| 1 turn
This spell strengthens one or more undead creatures within range. The caster can strengthen a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to his caster level. Each strengthened undead gains 1d10 temporary hit points + 1 additional temporary hp per caster level. These temporary hit points will be the first lost if any damage is suffered, but cannot be regained through rest or healing magic, and will disappear at the expiration of the spell’s duration. A dispel evil or dispel magic spell will strip the undead of its temporary hit points unless its makes a successful saving throw versus Spells.

#### Summon Manes
| Range:|	30’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|		Duration:|	1 day
The caster summons one manes per level of experience from the Outer Darkness to serve him (see p. XX of the Heroic Monsters chapter for details). The manes appear anywhere within range. The wretched demons will slavishly respond to the caster’s will. The manes vanish when destroyed or dispelled, or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

#### Summon Insect Swarm
|	Range:|	10’
|:
|Eldritch |2 (Black)
|Duration:|	1 day
The caster summons a 4 HD insect swarm from the dark places of the earth (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). The insect swarm forms anywhere within range. The summoned swarm will mindlessly respond to the caster’s will. The insect swarm will vanish when destroyed or dispelled, or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

#### Summon Ooze
|Range:|	10’
|:
|Eldritch |3 (Black)
|Duration:|	1 day
The caster summons his choice of a gelatinous cube, gray ooze, green slime, or yellow mold from the dark places of the earth (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). The summoned ooze appears anywhere within range. The summoned ooze will mindlessly respond to the caster’s will. The summoned ooze will vanish when destroyed or dispelled, or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it cannot be cast more than once per day.

#### Summon Shadows
|Range:|	10’
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (Black)
|Duration:|	1 week
The caster summons 1d4 shadows from the Outer Darkness to serve him (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). The shadows appear anywhere within range. The summoned shadows will respond to the caster’s will, as will any shadows spawned by them, up to a maximum of four shadows. (Any excess shadows depart for the Outer Darkness.) However, shadows are hateful creatures inimical to all life, and will always attempt to twist the meaning of their orders to wreak as much evil as possible. More than one spellcaster has seen friends and lovers damned by the depredations of such minions. The shadows will vanish when destroyed or dispelled, or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it cannot be cast more than once per week.

#### Summon Hell Hounds
|Range:|	10’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Black)
|Duration:|	special
The caster summons 1d4+3 lesser hell hounds from the Elemental Sphere of Fire to do his bidding (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). The number of hell hounds summoned is increased to 1d4+4 if the caster is 12th level or higher, and 1d4+5 if 14th level or higher. The hell hounds appear anywhere within range. When summoned, the hell hounds must be tasked with a single objective, such as guarding a location or hunting down a particular creature. The spell expires when this task is completed or one month elapses, whichever comes first. Hell hounds are hateful, Chaotic creatures who wish to see the world burn, and they will always interpret their orders in order to maximize the destruction they can inflict. The hell hounds will vanish when destroyed or dispelled or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it cannot be cast more than once per week.

#### Summon Invisible Stalker
|Range:|	10’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Black)
|Duration:|	special
The caster summons an invisible stalker from the Outer Darkness to do his bidding (see the Monsters chapter of Adventurer Conqueror King System for details). A second invisible stalker is summoned if the caster is 13th level or higher. The invisible stalker(s) can be summoned anywhere within range. When summoned, the invisible stalker must be tasked with a single objective, such as guarding a location or hunting down a particular creature. (If more than one is summoned, both must receive the same task.) The spell expires when this task is completed. However, invisible stalkers resent protracted missions or complex tasks and will seek to pervert their instructions accordingly. The invisible stalker(s) will vanish when destroyed or dispelled or when the spell expires. Because of the soul-blasting nature of this spell, it requires one turn (10 minutes) to cast, and cannot be cast more than once per week.

#### Summon Weather
|Range:| 5 miles or more
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)		
|Duration:| 6 turns per level
This spell summons a weather condition to the spellcaster’s location. The summoned weather must be of a natural and routine type that regularly occurs in that location at that time of year. Freak weather (such as snow in summer) and natural disasters (such as blizzards, hurricanes, typhoons, or tornados) are prohibited, but the caster could relieve a drought with rain or call up a dust cloud in the desert. The weather is affected out to a range of five miles, plus one mile for each level of the caster above the minimum level required to cast the spell.

#### Sunder Structure
|	Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|	Duration:|	instantaneous
The caster of this mighty spell can obliterate a structure such as a bridge, cliff, tower, or wall by striking it with his staff or other implement. The caster must make a melee attack throw against the structure’s AC (typically 2 for wooden and 6 for stone structures). If the attack throw succeeds, the targeted structure is instantly dealt 250 SHP of damage (enough to destroy one story of a tower or a 30’ length of wall). If the targeted structure is destroyed, each creature on or within it suffers 5d6 points of damage from collapsing rubble, or half as much damage if it makes a successful saving throw versus Blast. Structures with multiple stories have a separate shp per story, and each story must be breached or destroyed separately; destroying a lower story will destroy all upper stories, however.

#### Swimming		
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (White)
|Duration:| 6 turns plus 1 turn per level
The recipient of this spell gains the ability to swim at a combat movement rate of 20’. The affected creature must have at least three limbs (hands and feet) free to swim, but needs no climbing gear or handholds. While swimming, the recipient can charge or run, attack with a one-handed weapon, cast spells, and defend itself normally. This spell does not grant the ability to breathe underwater.

#### Thunderbolt
|Range:|	0’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
The caster releases a thunderous blast of electricity that is 120’ long. The thunderbolt passes through an area 5' wide, arcing and jumping, so that, while it is not actually 5' wide, for game purposes treat it as if it is so. Any creatures caught in the area of effect of the thunderbolt must make a saving throw versus Blast. A creature that fails the saving throw suffer 1d6 points of electricity damage per level of the caster and is deafened by the shock and thunder. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw suffers half damage but is not deafened.

A deafened creature suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls and a -4 penalty on ceremony throws and spellsinging throws, and has a 2 in 6 chance of failing any attempt to cast a spell, read a scroll, or utter a command word. A deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened.

The thunderbolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward the caster, or in a random direction at the Judge's option. Creatures already affected by the thunderbolt do not take additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt. A thunderbolt is so loud that it can be heard as a low rumble by creatures up to 10 miles away.

#### Thunderclap
|Range:|	60’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Grey)
|	Duration:|	instantaneous
A deafening peal of thunder resounds at a point of the caster’s choice. The thunderclap is so loud that it can be heard as a low rumble by creatures up to 10 miles away. Each creature within 5’ of the thunderclap must make saving throw versus Blast. If the save fails, the creature suffers 1d6 points of damage and is deafened. If the save succeeds, the creature suffers half damage but is not deafened (though its ears may ache and ring). A deafened creature suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls and a -4 penalty on ceremony throws and spellsinging throws, and has a 2 in 6 chance of failing any attempt to cast a spell, read a scroll, or utter a command word. A deafened creature can make another saving throw at the end of its initiative each round. If the save succeeds, it is no longer deafened.

#### Transform Other
|	Range:|	touch
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|Duration:|	permanent
This spell allows the caster to change the target touched into another form of living creature. The target’s new form can’t have more Hit Dice than caster’s level, and must have fewer than twice the Hit Dice of the target’s old form. Incorporeal or gaseous forms cannot result from a transform other, nor can forms of constructs, elementals, or undead. The spell cannot create a duplicate of a specific individual.

While transformed, the target gains the physical capabilities, statistics, physical attacks, and special abilities of the new form while retaining his own mental abilities (usually to his horror). The target creature will have the same number of hit points it previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed.

An attack throw is required to touch an unwilling target (unless it is helpless). Unwilling targets that successfully make a saving throw versus Spells are not affected. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, and creatures with shape changing abilities such as a doppelganger can revert to their natural form in one round. Otherwise, the spell is permanent until dispelled by dispel magic or the creature is slain, at which time the target’s corpse reverts to its original form.

#### Transform Self
|Range:|	self
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (White)
|Duration:|	6 turns plus 1 turn per level
This spell allows the caster to change into another form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more Hit Dice than the caster's level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or gaseous form, or the form of a construct, elemental, or undead creature, and cannot become a duplicate of a specific individual. If slain, the caster reverts to his original form.

While transformed, the caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the new form while retaining his own mental abilities. He also gains all physical attacks and special, supernatural, or spell-like abilities possessed by the new form. Were the caster to assume the form of a dragon he could use the dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, as well as its dragon breath and other special abilities. The caster will have the same number of hit points he previously had, regardless of the Hit Dice of the form assumed. The caster can remain transformed for the full duration of the spell, or may choose to end the spell whenever he desires.

#### Tremor
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|Duration:| concentration
This spell causes the earth near the caster to begin to spasm and shake violently. The caster can choose to have the tremor radiate outward from him along the ground in all directions to a 50’ radius, or blast outward along the ground in a flat cone  150’ long and 100’ wide. Creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw versus Blast every round. Those that fail the saving throw are knocked down and suffer 1d6 points of damage. Those that succeed on the saving throw retain their footing and suffer no damage. Creatures gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category larger than man-sized. Buildings in the area of effect suffer 1shp of damage per round per 10’ square area.  A tremor can only be brought forth if the caster is standing on soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock and it is halted by deep water (5’ or more).

#### Turn to Dust
|Range:| 150’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (White)
|Duration:| instantaneous
This spell can turn a single undead creature within range into dust. The target of the spell can make a saving throw versus Death to resist the effect. If the save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If the save fails, the target is instantly destroyed. Turn to dust has no effect on living creatures or constructs.

#### Unliving Puppet
|Range:| 60’
|:
|Eldritch| 1 (Black)
|Duration:| concentration
This spell raises the bones or body of a single dead creature within range as an undead skeleton or zombie under the caster's mental control. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse.

Skeletons will have Hit Dice equal to the number the monster had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies will have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life. Unlike animate dead, the HD of the skeleton or zombie created are not limited by the caster’s level. However, only creatures of less than 8 HD can be raised by this spell. An unliving puppet remains animated until destroyed or dispelled, or until the caster relinquishes concentration. The creature’s remains crumble to dust when the spell ends.

#### Vitriolic Infusion
| Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
|Duration:| 1 day
This spell infuses water with concentrated vitriol, transforming it into a highly-damaging vitriolic infusion. A single casting will transform six flasks of water. When a flask of vitriolic infusion is thrown, resolve the effects as if it were a flask of burning oil (see ACKS, p. XX). The magical infusion will evaporate in one day if unused. The spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon magic potions, oil, or holy water.
 
#### Voice of Persuasion
|Range:| 120’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
|Duration:| 6 turns
With sweet and sonorous tones, the caster persuades a living creature to comply with his will. If the target fails a saving throw versus Spells, he will oblige the caster’s requests as if subject to a charm for the duration of the spell. If the target of the spell is currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton; rather, it responds to his requests in the most favorable way. The target will not do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional saving throw to overcome orders contrary to its nature (at the Judge's discretion). The caster must speak the charmed creature’s language to communicate any commands.

#### Voice of Command
|Range: |120’
|:
|Eldritch |4 (Grey)		
|Duration: |6 turns
With authoritative and resonant tones, the caster forces a living creature to comply with his will. For the duration of the spell, the caster may give the target a series of one sentence commands, each of which it obeys to the best of its ability until given further orders. Each sentence must make sense in itself, such as “slay those orcs,” “drop your weapons,” “flee from this place,” or “kneel before me.” The target cannot be ordered to knowingly cause himself direct harm, but it can be commanded to undertake aggressive or risky action. Note that the caster must be able to speak the language of the target. The target is entitled to a saving throw versus Spells to avoid the effect.

#### Wave of Earth
|Range:| 0’
|:
|Eldritch| 2 (Grey)
|Duration:| 1 round
This spell causes the earth to swell into a heaving wave 5’ wide and tall that travels 120’ away from the caster along the ground in any desired direction. Creatures that begin their initiative in, or enter, the wave’s path must make a saving throw versus Blast. Those that fail the saving throw are knocked down and suffer 1d6 points of damage. Those that succeed on the saving throw retain their footing and suffer no damage. Creatures gain a +4 bonus to the saving throw per size category larger than man-sized. The wave of earth can only be brought forth along an area of soil, sand, silt, clay, or uncut, unworked rock. The wave cannot be conjured on an area of worked stone, wood, cement, concrete, metal, or water deeper than 5’, and if it encounters such an area, it immediately comes to a halt.

#### Weave Fire
|	Range:|	60'
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (Grey)
| 	Duration:|	2 turns
This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of fire, up to a maximum of 100 cubic feet, into a different shape. Weave fire does not create the fire itself, so it must be cast on a bonfire, forest fire, etc. The spell cannot affect fire carried or held by creatures, or in which there are creatures already, nor can it impact creatures. It cannot affect a carried torch, for instance, or weave fire straight into an enemy.

Due to the enchantments placed up on it, the woven fire is impenetrable to monsters with fewer than 4 HD. Monsters with more than 4 HD suffer 1d6 hit points of damage when they pass through the fire. The fire deals double damage to creatures that are especially susceptible to fire. The fire is opaque. The fire may not be woven to be less than 1” thick.

Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the fire into almost any shape he desires. The resulting shape need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must eventually merge with the fire’s kindling source. When the spell expires, the fire sputters out wherever there is not appropriate fuel, and thereafter burns as a natural fire.

#### Weave Metal
|Range:|	120’
|:
|Eldritch| 6 (Grey)
|Duration:|	permanent
This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of metal, up to a maximum of 85 cubic feet, into a different shape.  Weave metal does not create the metal itself, so it must be cast on a metal vein, treasure pile, etc. The spell cannot affect metal carried or held by creatures, or on which there are creatures already, nor can it be woven into creatures. For instance, it could not weave a suit of armor worn by a foe or weave a bronze door into an enemy. The metal cannot be woven to less than the thickness of a coin.

Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the metal into almost any shape he desires - bars, ingots, doors, furniture, walls, etc. The metal can be woven into one or more free-standing and movable objects, or bonded to surrounding nonliving material, provided in either case that the base of the shape rests on a firm foundation (i.e. the metal cannot be woven to float in thin air). If the caster has appropriate proficiencies, such as Craft (coin-minting) or Engineering, the final shape will be well-worked, as if by the hand of the caster himself; otherwise the final shape will be crude, but serviceable.

If weave metal is cast as part of a construction project, apply 250gp towards the project’s construction cost per casting. The weaving is permanent, but the metal is still subject to destruction from damage, rust, perforation, tarnishing, and other natural phenomena.

#### Weave Smoke
|	Range:|	120'
|:
|Eldritch |1 (Grey)
|	Duration:|	1 turn
This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of fog and smoke, up to a maximum of 1,000 cubic feet, into a different shape. The spell does not create the smoke itself, so it must be cast on morning mist, banks of fog, smoke from a fire, etc. The smoke may not be woven so that it appears where objects or creatures already are, nor can it be woven into creatures. The smoke may not be woven to be less than 1” thick.

Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the smoke into almost any shape he desires. The resulting shape need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation. If woven to at least 6” thickness, woven smoke will block vision, and if woven to 1’ thickness, it will block both vision and light. Smoke never presents an obstacle to movement or magical effects (except for those requiring a line of sight to target, of course). Once woven, the smoke can still be affected by water or strong winds like an ordinary cloud of smoke, though other attacks will have correspondingly little effect on it. A disintegrate or dispel magic spell will disperse the woven smoke instantly; it will otherwise dissipate in 1 turn.

#### Weave Stone
|Range:|	60’
|:
|Eldritch| 5 (Grey)
|	Duration:| permanent
This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of earth and stone, up to a maximum of 500 cubic feet, into a different shape. Weave stone does not create the stone itself, so it must be cast on a building, earthen rampart, wall, etc. The spell cannot affect stone carried or held by creatures, nor on which there are creatures already, nor can it be woven into creatures. For instance, it could not be used to create a pillar under a creature, nor to remove a bridge from beneath a creature’s feet. The stone may not be woven to be less than 1” thick.

Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the stone into almost any shape he desires – boulders, bridges, building blocks, walls, etc. The stone can be woven into one or more free-standing and movable objects, or bonded to surrounding nonliving material, provided in either case that the base of the shape rests on a firm foundation (i.e. the stone cannot be woven to float in thin air). The woven stone can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20’, the stone must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. If the caster has appropriate proficiencies, such as Craft (stonemason) or Engineering, the final shape will be well-worked, as if by the hand of the caster himself; otherwise the final shape will be crude, but serviceable.

If weave stone is cast as part of a stone construction project, apply 250gp towards the project’s construction cost per casting. The weaving is permanent but the stone is still subject to destruction from damage, erosion, and other natural phenomena.

#### Weave Water
|Range:|	120'
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (Grey)
|Duration:|	2 turns
This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of water, up to a maximum of 100 cubic feet, into a different shape. Weave water does not create the water itself, so it must be cast on a fountain, lake, river, etc. The spell cannot affect water carried or held by creatures, nor in which there are creatures already, nor can it be woven into creatures. The water may not be woven to be less than 1” thick.

Due to the enchantments placed up on it, the woven water is impenetrable to monsters with fewer than 4 HD. Monsters with more than 4 HD suffer 1d6 hit points of damage when they swim or wade through the water. The water deals double damage to creatures that use fire or are accustomed to hot conditions. The water is translucent.

Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the water into almost any shape he desires. The resulting shape need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must eventually merge with and be solidly supported by existing water. When the spell expires, the weaving collapses spectacularly and the water returns to its natural shape.

#### Weave Wood
|Range:|	120’
|:
|Eldritch| 4 (Grey)
|Duration:|	permanent
This spell allows the caster to manipulate an existing volume of nonliving wood, up to a maximum of 100 cubic feet, into a different shape. Weave wood does not create the wood itself, so it must be cast on a wooden building, fence, palisade, etc. The spell cannot weave wood carried or held by creatures, nor on which there are creatures already, nor can it  be woven into creatures. For instance, it could not be used to re-shape a creature’s shield, nor could it remove a wooden bridge from beneath a creature’s feet. The wood may not be woven to be less than the thickness of a shield (1/2”).

Subject to those limitations, the caster can weave the wood into almost any shape he desires – beams, chairs, doors, shelves, walls, etc. The wood can be woven into one or more free-standing and movable objects, or bonded to surrounding nonliving material, provided in either case that the base of the shape rests on a firm foundation (i.e. the wood cannot be woven to float in thin air). The woven wood can be used to bridge a chasm or as a ramp with a span of up to 20’. If the caster has appropriate proficiencies, such as Craft (carpentry) or Engineering, the final shape will be well-worked, as if by the hand of the caster himself; otherwise the final shape will be crude, but serviceable.

If weave wood is cast as part of a wooden construction project, apply 250gp towards the project’s construction cost per casting. The weaving is permanent but the wood is still subject to destruction from damage, fire, rot, and other natural phenomena.


### New and Updated Rituals

#### Gate
|Range:|	30’
|:
|Eldritch| 9 (Black)
|Duration:|	special
At the completion of this powerful ritual, the caster utters the true name of a specific extraplanar creature of great power (such as a demon, devil, demigod, or even god) from whom he seeks aid and assistance. This utterance attracts the creature’s attention and allows it, or its representative, to travel to the caster’s vicinity by means of an interdimensional portal simultaneously created by the ritual’s completion – the eponymous gate itself. If the creature named is anything short of a deity or demon lord, it will usually travel through the gate itself. Gods, demon lords, and other planar rulers will likely send a representative rather than come through the gate personally. The Judge’s discretion is final with regard to what creature comes through the gate.

In either case, the creature arriving through the gate is not under the control of the caster. Its actions will be determined by its alignment, its relationship with the caster, the reason for its summoning, and the nature of the threats it confronts. If a creature is called by a caster of an opposed alignment seeking assistance in pursuing goals contrary to the creature’s own, it will attempt to destroy the caster if possible, or depart if not. If a creature is called for a trifling matter (relative to its own power), it might depart immediately, or perhaps linger long enough to chastise the caster for his impudence, even going so far as to lay a curse or quest upon him. Usually, however, the creature will provide some aid or assistance to the caster, especially if his need is great and his goals align with those of the creature itself.

After aiding the caster, the creature will typically demand payment of some sort for its service – the payment demanded might be services, treasure, blood sacrifices, or even some part of the caster’s own body, such as an eye or hand. The payment demand is at the Judge’s discretion based on the power of the creature relative to the caster and the reason for its summoning. For creatures other than gods and demon lords summoned to aid characters of their own alignment, a payment of 1,000 gp (or equivalent) per HD of the creature will usually suffice.

Casting a gate ritual requires 4,500 gp of divine power as its special component.

#### Holy Word
|Range:|	0’
|:
|Eldritch| 7 (White)
|Duration:|	instantaneous
This ritual culminates with the utterance of a powerful holy word which affects all evil creatures within a 30-foot radius around the caster. For purposes of the ritual, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster’s alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment. The effects of the holy word are shown on the table below:

| Creature’s HD or Level | Effect of Holy Word |	Movement Penalty | Attack Penalty | Spellcasting
|:
| 3 or Less	| Killed/destroyed instantly	| Dead	| Dead	| Dead
| 4 to 7+	| Paralyzed 1d4 turns	| Paralyzed	| Paralyzed	| Paralyzed
| 8 to 11+	| Slowed and stunned for 2d4 rounds	| Halved	| -4, Slowed	| None permitted
| 12 or More	| Deafened for 1d4 rounds	| None	| -2	| 3 in 6 chance of failure

In addition, if the caster is on his home plane, all evil creatures from other planes within the area of effect are banished to their own plane of existence for 24 hours unless they make a saving throw versus Spells. There is no saving throw against the other effects of a holy word, though magical resistance can protect against it.

Reversed, this spell becomes unholy word. Its effects are identical to those noted above, except that it is a black magic ritual that affects good rather than evil creatures.

Casting a holy word or unholy word ritual requires 3,500 gp of divine power as its special component.

#### Lair of Power
|Range:|	special
|:
|Eldritch| 9 (Grey)
|Duration:|	permanent
This ritual transforms the caster’s lair into a place of power. For purposes of this spell, a lair can be a man-made or natural site encompassing an area of up to 10,000 square feet and a volume of up to 100,000 square feet. For example, a lair might encompass the entirety of a rambling one-story manor house (100’ long x 100’ wide x 10’ tall) or a tall, spindly stone pillar (30’ long x 30’ wide x 110’ tall).

When the ritual is begun, the caster selects the type of place he desires his lair to become: either a pinnacle of good, sinkhole of evil, aerie of air, edifice of earth, furnace of fire, or well of water. In order to create a lair of power of a particular type, the caster must meet the requirements noted below for that type.

| Type of Place	| Requirement
|:
| Pinnacle of Good	| Caster must be Lawful and have no corrupting weaknesses
| Sinkhole of Evil	| Caster must be Chaotic and have at least five corrupting weaknesses
| Aerie of Air	| Caster must know at least one elemental air spell of each level (1st – 6th)
| Edifice of Earth	| Caster must know at least one elemental earth spell of each level (1st – 6th)
| Furnace of Fire	| Caster must know at least one elemental fire spell of each level (1st – 6th)
| Well of Water	| Caster must know at least one elemental water spell of each level (1st – 6th)

While the ritual is being performed, the lair must be kept empty of any creatures except the caster and his assistants, apprentices, henchmen, followers, familiars, animal companions, charmed or necromantic slaves, and similar allies. If other creatures arrive in the lair during the ritual, they must be slain, driven off, or enlisted into the caster’s service before the ritual can proceed.

When the ritual is complete, the caster’s lair becomes a minor place of power of the chosen type. If the lair is already a minor place of power of the chosen type, the lair becomes a major place of power of that type instead. If the lair is already a major place of power of the chosen type, the lair becomes a supreme place of power of that type instead.
 
If the lair is already a supreme place of power of the chosen type, the caster must immediately make a saving throw versus Spells. Fate Points cannot be spent on this roll. If the save succeeds, the lair of power gains a permanent gate to the appropriate sphere of existence. If the save fails, the caster is immediately disintegrated and a cataclysm appropriate to the type of place occurs in the hex, centered on the lair.

A caster may “stack” multiple lairs of power of different types in the same physical area if desired. However, he must meet all of the requirements for each type of place and perform separate rituals (or series of rituals) for each type. For instance, a caster might perform the ritual three times to create a roaring (major) aerie of air and smoldering (minor) furnace of fire.

#### Symbol
|Range: |touch
|:
|Eldritch| 8 (Grey)
|	Duration:|	special
This ritual allows the caster to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. To be effective, a symbol must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Symbols are visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet.  Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol works normally.

Until it is triggered, a symbol is inactive. By default, a symbol is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. The caster can choose to limit the trigger to just a few or one of these triggers if desired. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol’s triggering conditions cannot be changed.

When triggered, a symbol will affect one or more creatures within 60 feet of the rune. The effect will vary depending on the type of symbol inscribed. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol is active may be subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.

When scribing a symbol, the caster can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.

There are eight different kinds of symbol, each of which has a different effect when triggered. Some of the symbols are considered black magic, however, and scribing those symbols will earn the caster corruption.

**Conflict:** The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to begin arguing with others in their area for 5d4 rounds. Arguing creatures of differing alignment may (50% chance) fight for 2d4 rounds.  Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of conflict with successful saving throws versus Spells.

**Death** (black): The symbol slays one or more creatures within 60’ whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 80. The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to slay. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of death with successful saving throws versus Death.

**Despair** (black): The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to endure feelings of hopelessness and futility for 3d4 turns. Affected creatures will automatically cower, surrender, or retreat in the face of determined opposition. Otherwise they have a 25% chance per round of taking no action due to their despair. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of despair with successful saving throws versus Paralysis.  

**Fear** (black): The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to flee at their running speed for 30 rounds, as if affected by the spell fear. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of fear with successful saving throws versus Spells at -4.  

**Insanity** (black): The symbol causes one or more creatures within 60’ whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 120 to become permanently insane (as the incite madness spell). The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. The insanity can only be cured with ritual magic. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of insanity with successful saving throws versus Spells.  

**Pain** (black): The symbol causes all creatures within 60’ to endure wracking pains for 2d10 turns. Affected creatures suffer a -1 penalty to initiative, -1 penalty to armor class, and -4 penalty to attack throws. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of pain with successful saving throws versus Spells.

**Sleep**: The symbol causes all creatures of 8 HD or less within 60’ to fall into a catatonic slumber for 1d12+4 turns. Catatonic creatures cannot be awakened by non-magical means before this time expires. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of sleep with successful saving throws versus Death.

**Stunning**: The symbol causes one or more creatures within 60’ whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 160 to become stunned and unable to act for 3d4 rounds. Any held items will be dropped. The symbol affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Creatures in the area of effect may resist the symbol of stunning with successful saving throws versus Paralysis.

Casting a symbol ritual requires special components worth 4,000 gp total.
