# Chapter 2: Heroes

<i>Hers was a hero, destin'd to command <br>
A martial race, and rule the Latian land, <br>
Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw, <br>
And on the conquer'd world impose the law.</i><br>
– The Aeneid, Book IV (Virgil)


## Ability Scores

By default, the Adventurer Conqueror King System assumes that adventurers are no more or less gifted than the average person. If they become great, it is because of their achievements in play, not because of special advantages during character generation. As a result, the ability scores for ACKS adventurers are generated by rolling 3d6 in order. If the optional Generating Multiple Characters rule is in effect, where players roll up five characters and select the best to play with, then adventurers are perhaps among the top 20% most talented people, but still drawn from the common stock. In some heroic campaign settings, however, the adventurers are men and women of extraordinary gifts – protagonists such as Achilles, Aeneas, Aragorn, Beowulf, Conan, Elric, and Red Sonja are gifted with might, confidence, and power far beyond the norm. 

To account for this, the Heroic Fantasy Handbook offers the following optional methods for rolling up characters with better ability scores.

- Heroic: Roll 4d6 for each ability score in order. Drop the lowest die, tally the remaining dice, and record that result. 
- Legendary: Roll 5d6 for each ability score in order. Drop the lowest 2 dice, tally the remaining dice, and record that result. 

Heroic characters will have ability scores in approximately the same range as the top fifth of normal characters (11-14, averaging 12.24). Legendary characters will have ability scores in approximately the same range as the top fifth of heroic characters (12-16, averaging 13.43). If desired the Judge can have players roll up five characters when using either method. 

EXAMPLE: Newton is creating an adventurer for use in a heroic campaign. The Judge has decided to use the optional “Legendary Ability Scores” and “Generating Multiple Characters” rules. Newton therefore will generate five characters; for each character, he will generate six ability scores, rolling 5d6 for each in order and dropping the lowest 2 dice. This combination of optional rules creates very powerful characters! Newton’s results are, in order for STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, and CHA: #1 STR 13, INT 17, WIS 11, DEX 15, CON 13, CHA 13;  #2 STR 13, INT 11, WIS 15, DEX 16, CON 11, CHA 15; #3 STR 6, INT 14, WIS 16, DEX 12, CON 12, CHA 13; #4  STR 14, INT 9, WIS 16, DEX 14, CON 17, CHA 14; #5 STR 15, INT 15, WIS 16, DEX 13, CON 14, CHA 17. He decides to select character #5. He selects Elven Spellsinger as his character class, reducing STR to 13 to increase CHA to 18. His final character has STR 13, INT 15, WIS 16, DEX 13, CON 14, CHA 18.

### Wisom Modifier

In heroic fantasy campaigns, a character’s WIS modifier should be applied to all saving throws, not just saving throws versus magic.


## Hit Points

Hit points are a measure of a character’s ability to survive in combat. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. A character with 40 hp cannot survive eight sword stabs to the stomach! Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant. Therefore, the amount of damage a weapon deals must be understood relative to the hit points of the character struck. It is the percentage of hit points lost, not the raw number lost, that indicates how physically wounded a character or monster is. 

However, in virtually every retro-clone (including ACKS), the elegant abstraction of hit points is marred by an asymmetry between damage and healing. Consider two characters, a normal man with 5 hp and an epic hero with 40 hp. When the normal man is dealt 4 points of damage by a sword, this is a grievous blow (80% of his hit points); when the epic hero is dealt the same 4 points of damage, this is merely a flesh wound (10% of his hp). This is exactly as it should be. Yet when the epic hero is treated with cure light wounds, he recovers 1d6+1 points of damage – enough to repair a light wound, as the spell suggests; while when the normal man is treated with cure light wounds, he is likely to recover from what we just said was a grievous blow that brought him near death. To fix this asymmetry, The Heroic Fantasy Handbook offers rules for proportional healing. 

### Healing

All beings recover hit points through rest. For each full day of complete rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a creature will recover its base healing rate (BHR). If its rest is interrupted, the creature will not heal that day. A creature’s base healing rate is based on its maximum hit points, as shown on the Base Healing Rate table. A character’s BHR should be recorded on its character sheet, and updated each time the character gains additional hit points. 

EXAMPLE: Athelstan has 12 hp. His base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day. With a full day of complete rest in sanitary conditions, Athelstan will recover between 1 and 4 hp. If his rest is interrupted, he will not heal.

| Max HP        | BHR (hp/day)
| :------------ | ------------:
| 1-3           |            -3
| 4-9           |            -2
| 10-16         |            -1
| 17-23         |             0
| 24-29         |            +1
|30-36          |       	1d10
|37-49	        |           2d6
|50-63	        |           2d8
|64-76	        |           2d10
|77-89	        |           2d12
|90-110	        |           3d10
|111-140	    |           4d10
|141-170	    |           5d10
|171+	        |           6d10, plus 1d10 per 30hp past 170

Characters with the Healing proficiency can shorten their patient’s recovery time. A patient under treatment of Healing recovers twice his base healing rate in hp each day of rest.

EXAMPLE: If Athelstan were the patient of a character with Healing proficiency, he would recover twice his base healing rate of 1d4 hp per day of rest, i.e. 2d4 hp per day of rest.  

Healing also occurs through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous and will typically be equal to one or more days of rest, as shown on the Magical Healing table. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined. 

EXAMPLE: Athelstan (with 12 hp and a base healing rate of 1d4 hp) has sustained 9 points of damage, leaving him with 3 hp. A cleric treats him with comfrey. Comfrey heals its target by half as much as if he had rested for one day, rounded up. Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day, so he will heal 1d4/2 hp. The result of the roll is a 3, so Athelstan is healed (3 / 2) 1.5 hp, rounded up to 2 hp. The cleric then casts cure moderate wounds on Athelstan. Cure moderate wounds heals its target as if he had rested for two days, so Athelstan will heal 2d4 hp. The result of the roll is a 5, so Athelstan is healed 5 points. He now has 10 hp of his maximum of 12. 

|Spell/Magic Item	|   Effect*
|:------------|------------:
|Salving Rest   |	The target’s base healing rate is doubled for non-magical healing.
|Cure Light Wounds  |	The target is healed as if he had rested for one day.
|Cure Moderate Wounds   |	The target is healed as if he had rested for two days.
|Cure Major Wounds  |	The target is healed as if he had rested for three days.
|Cure Serious Wounds    |	The target is healed as if he had rested for four days.
|Cure Critical Wounds   |	The target is healed as if he had rested for five days.
|Spirit of Healing  |	Each round, the target is healed as if he had rested for one day.
|Lay on Hands   |	The target is healed as if he had rested for one day per two levels of the healer (rounded up).
|Comfrey    |	The target is healed by half as much as if he had rested for one day (rounded up). 
|Potion of Healing  |	The target is healed as if he had rested for one day.
|Potion of Extra-Healing    |	The target is healed as if he had rested for three days.

*These effects occur instead of the spell or magic item’s effect under the ACKS core rules.

<b>Heroic Breakfast Memorial Rule (Optional):</b> Once per day a character can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest. Halfling characters may consume a second breakfast for an additional recovery of hp. 

### Mortal Wounds

When a creature’s hit points drop to 0 or fewer, the creature is unconscious and possibly dead. The creature’s condition will not be determined until an ally treats its wounds. When this occurs, the unconscious creature must roll 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table and apply any appropriate modifiers listed. The modified 1d20 roll determines the unconscious creature’s condition while the modified 1d6 roll determines whether any permanent wounds are suffered. Characters not treated within 24 hours of being unconscious must roll, with no bonus for treatment and at the full -10 penalty for being treated 1 day later. 

<b>Heroic Survival:</b> In heroic fantasy campaigns, heroes are considerably more likely to survive mortal wounds than ordinary men. Adventurers with d6 HD add +2 to their 1d20 roll on the Mortal Wounds table. Adventurers with d8 HD add +4, adventurers with d10 HD add +6, and adventurers with d12 HD add +8.

Some results on the Mortal Wounds table will indicate that a character needs a period of bed rest to recover. During this time, the character cannot recover to more than 1 hp and cannot take any action other than speaking and moving at half speed. The period of bed rest can be shortened with magical healing – simply count the days of rest from the magical healing towards the recovery period. However, a character cannot benefit from more than one type of magical healing per day when recovering from mortal wounds.  

EXAMPLE: A fight goes badly, and Athelstan suffers grievous wounds; he will require 14 days of bed rest to recover. The party hires the patriarch of the local temple to cast cure critical wounds on Athelstan. This heals Athelstan as if he had rested for 5 days. Athelstan now requires (14-5) 9 days of bed rest to recover. 

If a character suffers permanent wounds, powerful healing magic such as a restore life and limb spell, regeneration spell, or ring of regeneration can eliminate any penalties caused. If applied swiftly, other types of healing can also eliminate the penalties from permanent wounds. If healing (magic or proficiency) restores the character to 1 hit point within 1 turn (10 minutes) of receiving the permanent wound, then the penalties from the permanent wound will be eliminated once the character completes the required bed rest. The permanent wound’s effects will still be present during the recovery period, however.  

EXAMPLE: During a defense of the town from orc raiders, Athelstan is reduced to -9 hp and must roll on the Mortal Wounds table. The roll goes badly – grievous wounds resulting in one of his arms being crushed. Fortunately, the patriarch of the local temple is nearby, and able to cast cure critical wounds on Athelstan just a few rounds after he is injured. Since Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp, cure critical wounds heals him of 5d4 hp. The roll is a 10, enough to raise him to 1 hp. When Athelstan finishes his period of bed rest (2 weeks), he will regain use of his arm. 

If a character dies, he can be revived with restore life and limb, reincarnation, or other magical effect that restores the dead to life. Characters treated with restore life and limb often need extensive periods of time to recover, and may suffer strange side effects. The character must roll 1d20+1d6 on the Tampering with Mortality table and apply any appropriate modifiers listed. The resulting side effects are permanent and can only be removed with a wish spell. The recovery period, if any, from tampering with mortality can be shorted with magical healing as described above. Note that magic which can restore the dead to life is very rare in campaigns using the Heroic Fantasy Handbook.

<b>Khal Drogo Memorial Rule (Optional):</b> In worlds where wounds can fester and grow foul there is no assurance that an injured hero will recover. Each day that a character rests while recovering from incapacitation, he must make a saving throw versus Death. Apply the character’s CON modifier to the saving throw. If the save succeeds, the day counts towards his period of bed rest. If the save fails, the character’s condition does not improve. If the save fails by 5 or more, or with a natural 1, the character’s condition worsens and the period of bed rest required advances by one day.  If the remaining period of bed rest required ever reaches more than 45 days, the character dies of sepsis, shock, or system failure. This optional rule does not apply to magical healing, but if you’re using this rule, you’re probably not allowing that anyway!

### Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points represent temporary blessings or inspiration during which character’s fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods is improved. Temporary hit points are not actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage.  Characters with temporary hit points who take damage lose the temporary hit points first, with any leftover damage carrying over to their normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. A character can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points. Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If a character has 0 or fewer hit points, receiving temporary hit points does not count as healing. 

## New and Modified Character Classes

In order to better represent the archetypes that appear in heroic fantasy, the Heroic Fantasy Handbook introduces several new campaign and racial classes. The core, campaign, and racial character classes presented in the Adventurer Conqueror King System and the Player’s Companion can also be used in Heroic Fantasy Handbook campaigns, although we recommend that some classes be modified or replaced, as noted below. To avoid forcing players to flip between multiple books, we have included complete descriptions of class powers such as turn undead even if they have already appeared elsewhere.

### New Character Classes

The new classes in this book include the beastmaster, berserker,  chosen, ecclesiastic, elven spellsinger, freebooter, halfling bounder, halfling burglar, loremaster, Nobiran champion, Nobiran wizard, occultist, runemaker, Thrassian deathchanter, warmistress, Zaharan darklord, and Zaharan sorcerer. In addition, a revised magic-free version of the venturer (originally appearing in the Player’s Companion) is presented.

### Beastmaster

<i>His straight and perfect figure, muscled as the best of the ancient Roman gladiators must have been muscled, and yet with the soft and sinuous curves of a Greek god, told at a glance the wondrous combination of enormous strength with suppleness and speed. A personification, was Tarzan of the Apes, of the primitive man, the hunter, the warrior. With the noble poise of his handsome head upon those broad shoulders, and the fire of life and intelligence in those fine, clear eyes, he might readily have typified some demigod of a wild and warlike bygone people of his ancient forest.</i> – Tarzan of the Apes (E.R. Burroughs)

Some kings and heroes, dreadful in aspect and demeanor, are whispered to have been raised by beasts, suckled by wolves, adopted by the wild. Such tales are rarely true. Most feral children live short and brutish lives, dying young without ever seeing another of their own kind; even if found, they have often regressed into a state of savagery from which their natural humanity cannot free them. But from time to time, a child, abandoned or lost to civilization and adopted by beasts, may be endowed with the strength and character to transcend both man and beast and become something greater. Such children, if they survive, become beastmasters – lords of the wild, combining the ferocity and toughness of a predator with the cunning and courage of a hero. 

Beastmasters fight with the instincts and aggression of natural predators. At first level, beastmasters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their damage from attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.  Beastmasters care nothing for civilized concepts such as chivalric combat, preferring to attack with surprise whenever possible. They may backstab as thieves of their class level. 

However, beastmasters lack formal training in arms and armor, and can wield only primitive weapons of the sort they could have fashioned in the wild: spears, hand axes, daggers, bolas, darts, nets, slings, saps, and staves. They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each had, but may not use shields nor wear armor.  They may use only magic items usable by fighters.

Due to their savage upbringing, beastmasters have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. They are constantly alert to danger, and can hear noises as a thief of their class level. From the unspeakable hardships they have endured, beastmasters gain savage resilience. When a beastmaster is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply.  Beastmasters also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover. 

At a young age, beastmasters learn to clamber up trees, cliffs, and other vertical services with the agility of a monkey. As a result, all beastmasters can climb as a thief of their class level. They also can perform feats of acrobatics such as swinging on vines or leaping over foes. In lieu of moving during a round, a beastmaster may attempt a proficiency throw of 20+ to tumble behind an opponent in melee. The proficiency throw required for the tumble is reduced by 1 per level of experience the character possesses. If successful, the beastmaster is now behind his opponent. The opponent loses the benefit of his shield, if any, and the beastmaster can backstab his opponent (gaining +4 to his attack throw and bonus damage based on his level). Beastmasters also gain a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the situation, such as tilting floors and pit traps.

Like other predators of the night, beastmasters are naturally stealthy, and opponents suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering them. Outdoors, beastmasters are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, a beastmaster who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. 

As natives of the wild, beastmasters bring significant advantages to parties on wilderness adventures. Any time the beastmaster’s party is in country familiar to the beastmaster, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the beastmaster’s party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. A party guided by a beastmaster can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+.  

Once per day, a beastmaster may shout a bestial cry that can be heard up to 750’ away.  Hostile ordinary animals hearing the cry must immediately make a successful morale roll or run away from the beastmaster. Other ordinary animals hearing the beastmaster’s cry may come to his assistance. If the animal is friendly to the beastmaster (e.g. if it is a henchman, a trained animal, or resident within 5 miles of his encampment) it will automatically run or fly to his assistance as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll for each animal, with a Friendly result indicating the creature comes to the beastmaster’s assistance. 

Having been raised by and with animals, all beastmasters are friends of birds and beasts. They understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character), which grants beastmasters a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and allows them to take animals as henchmen. They also can identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+.

Conversely, all beastmasters are discomfited by civilization. The sights, smells, and ways of cities are foreign and offensive to them. A beastmaster suffers a penalty to reaction rolls when in urban settlements equal to 7 minus the settlement’s market value. 

When purchasing starting equipment, a beastmaster may only select primitive weapons, animal parts (from Lairs & Encounters) blankets, healing herbs, ropes, poles, rations, sacks, stakes, tents, torches, and trained animals. However, any trained animals that the beastmaster begins play with may be immediately recruited as henchmen if desired. Any unspent coin is lost.

When a beastmaster reaches 5th level (Mighty Warrior), his animal magnetism begins to inspire the men and beasts that follow him. Any henchmen of the beastmaster, and any guard or hunting animals handled by the beastmaster, gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the beastmaster’s Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Lord of the Wild), a beastmaster can establish an encampment in a wilderness hex. A beastmaster’s encampment is often centered on a wooden cabin or house perched in the highest branches of a great tree. A beastmaster does not attract followers when he establishes an encampment, but he does gain the fellowship of animals: all ordinary animals within 5 miles of it become kind and helpful (as per an elven fastness).

### Berserker

*Soon the Berserkergang began to come on Valgard, he trembled and frothed and gnawed the rim of his shield, he rushed forward howling and slaying. His ax was a red blur, he did not feel weapons bite him, and the sheer terror of his rage-twisted face froze many men even while he cut them down. When the fit was over he was weak, but he had heaped corpses high.* – The Broken Sword (Poul Anderson)

Berserkers are barbarian warriors blessed by pagan gods with the power to enter a trance-like battle rage known as the berserkergang. While enraged, a berserker fights with bear-like ferocity and can shrug off blows that would fell normal men. Berserkers are feared even by their allies, for in the grip of the berserkergang, a man may cut down his dearest friend as easily as his bitterest foe. Some berserkers find their gift brings ruin on themselves, ending up as outlaws and kin-slayers without family or friend; but most are recruited into warrior-cults of like-minded brothers, where they learn to master their fury. In time, berserkers may become famous raiders, housecarls, or even great chieftains. In the Auran Empire, berserkers might be reavers from the bleak wastes of northern Jutland, fierce lancers from Skysostan, or savage tribesmen from the Ivory Kingdom jungles of Keita, Munde, and Kushtu. 

At first level, berserkers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Berserkers increase their base damage roll from successful melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Although sometimes skilled with missile and especially thrown weapons, a berserker revels in close combat, fighting his enemies eye to eye, not at a distance.
Berserkers enter battle without care for life and limb, and may only wear leather or lighter armor. Like their barbarian kinsmen, they are limited to fighting with the traditional weapons and styles of their tribe. When a berserker is created, select a region of origin for the character from the Regional Origin table below and note down the permitted weapons and fighting styles. The Judge may create other regions of origin within his own campaign setting where necessary. (Note that berserkers do not share their barbarian kinsmen’s natural proficiency. Some berserkers may choose to use a class proficiency to match their kinsmen, while other berserkers choose to stand apart from their kinsmen and learn different skills.) Berserkers may only use magic items usable by fighters.

| Region  | Weapons Permitted | Fighting Styles Permitted 
| :------ | :---------------------------- | :---------------- |
| Jutland | Battle axe, club, dagger, great axe, hand axe, shortbow, spear, sword, two-handed sword, war hammer | Weapon & shield, two-handed weapon
| Skysostan | Composite bow, dagger, hand axe, javelin, lance, net, sling, short sword (scimitar), spear, whip | Weapon & shield, two weapons
| Ivory Kingdoms | Bola, club, dart, dagger, hand axe, javelin, net, shortbow, short sword, spear | Weapon & shield, two weapons

Like the hardy barbarians from which they are drawn, berserkers resist injury with savage resilience. When a berserker is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Berserkers subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.

What sets the berserker apart from his barbarian kin is his ability to enter berserkergang, the killing rage of mayhem and madness. A berserker’s rage encompasses both lesser and greater states. A berserker may enter a lesser berserkergang at will. Entering a lesser berserkergang does not count as an action, so the berserker may freely go berserker, move, and attack on the same round. While in a lesser berserkergang, a berserker gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and becomes immune to fear. However, the berserker suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot retreat from combat. Once it has begun, a lesser berserkergang cannot be ended until combat ends. 

While some ferocious fighters and brutal barbarians also learn to enter the lesser berserkergang (by selecting the Berserkergang proficiency) the greater berserkergang is unique to the berserker class. A berserker may enter the greater  berserkergang only once per day. (A berserker who selects ranks of the Berserkergang proficiency increases the number of times per day he can enter greater berserkergang by one per rank.) Entering a greater berserkergang requires 1 full round (10 seconds), during which time the berserker works himself into a frenzy, biting on his shield, foaming at the mouth, and howling like a wild animal. While in a greater berserkergang, the berserker gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. Additionally the berserker decreases the damage from any non-magical attacks by 1 point per die. (Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity.) This protection increases to 2 points per die at 7th level and 3 points per die at 13th level. 

EXAMPLE: Beorn is a 7th level berserker. He is struck by an ogre, dealing 2d6 damage. The damage roll is a 3 and a 5, but Beorn reduces the damage from non-magical attacks by 2 points per die, so he takes 1 and 3. Beorn therefore only takes 4 damage from the ogre. The damage reduction is applied per die. 

However, a berserker in a state of greater berserkergang cannot retreat from combat, and has trouble distinguishing friend from foe. If a berserker in a greater berserkergang rolls a natural 1 on an attack throw, he automatically hits a nearby ally within 5’ in lieu of his preferred target. Once begun, a greater berserkergang cannot be ended until combat ends. When the greater berserkergang ends, the berserker is immediately exhausted. While exhausted, the berserker cannot charge or run, and suffers a -1 penalty on attack and proficiency throws. A berserker can recover from exhaustion by resting for 1 turn (10 minutes). 

Outsiders may view a berserker’s rage as a curse or madness, but berserkers know that their powers are actually gifts granted by the pagan gods. The berserker’s relationship to the gods is embodied in a totem animal such as bear totem, boar totem, or wolf totem.  At 1st level (Hunter), a berserker discovers the nature of his totem and gains its totem benefit, a bonus proficiency related to the totem. The berserker’s totem should be appropriate to the character’s ability scores and tribal traditions. At a minimum, the berserker must possess an ability score of at least 9 in his totem’s key ability. Over time, the berserker will come to resemble his totem animal. For instance, a bear berserker might become burly and hirsute, a wolf berserker might become yellow-eyed, lean, and toothy, and a hyena berserker may develop a hunchback and braying laugh. Berserkers often organize themselves into warrior-cults dedicated to their particular totem animal. 

The Totem Animals table, below, lists the key abilities and totem benefits of several sample totems. The Judge may create additional totems at his discretion. Berserkers from Jutland traditionally select either bear, boar, or wolf; from Skysostan, either eagle, hyena, or tiger; and from the Ivory Kingdoms, bull, lion, or panther. 

Starting at 5th level (reaver), a berserker gains the ability to shapechange into his totem animal. The berserker remains in his new shape until he changes back. A 5th level berserker can initially shapechange once per day. For example, if he begins the day in human form, he can shapechange into his totem animal form, but he then has to remain in totem animal form until the following day, when he can change back to his human shape. With each level of experience gained, the berserker can change shape one additional time per day. When in totem animal form, the berserker has the movement, armor class, attacks, damage, and powers listed on the Totem Animals table, below. He retains his normal Hit Dice, hit points, attack throws, and saving throws. If the berserker is of greater Hit Dice than his animal type, he will appear as a bigger, stronger version of the animal, to a maximum of twice normal size. For example, a 10th level berserker in lion shape would appear as a huge predator, twice the mass of a normal lion. A larger-than normal totem animal form increases each damage die by +1. Apart from size, the berserker is indistinguishable from a normal animal. The totem animal shape does not detect as magical, is not detected by spells that reveal illusions, and cannot be dispelled. Changing shape can be performed during combat in lieu of making an attack. Alternatively, a berserker may expend a use of shapechange to enter into a greater berserkergang, tapping into his animal spirit to unleash his inner savagery.

Note that while a berserker’s relationship to his totem animal resembles that of a shaman’s, berserkers do not acquire an actual animal companion – they merely take on some of the characteristics of their totem.


|Totem Animal | Key Ability | Totem Benefit | Shapechanged Characteristics

|Bear         | STR         | Berserkergang     | Move 120’, AC3, HD 4ǂ, #AT 3, Dmg 1d3/1d3/1d6, bear hug

|Wolf         | CON         | Running           | Move 180’, AC2, HD 2+2ǂ, #AT 1, Dmg 1d6

ǂ Berserker retains his normal HD and hp; but if berserker’s HD exceed totem animal form’s HD, increase damage die by +1


At 5th level a berserker’s animal magnetism also begins to inspire those who follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the berserker gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the berserker’s Charisma or proficiencies.

Upon reaching 9th level (Warchief), a berserker can build or claim a chieftain’s hall. When the berserker establishes his hall, 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 berserkers of 1st-3rd level will serve him. The berserkers will be of the same region and totem animal as their warchief. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Chieftains’ halls are otherwise identical to fighters’ castles, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.

At 9th level a  berserker also gains the ability to spiritwalk. After 1 turn (10 minutes) of chanting, the berserker enters a deep trance during which his spirit walks free of his body. Once a spiritwalk begins, it continues until the berserker’s spirit returns to his body, to a maximum duration of 1 hour per level. A spiritwalking berserker’s spirit can assume either human or totem animal shape as desired. In either shape, the berserker can see and hear normally, move around at his shape’s normal movement rate, and pass through solid objects without difficulty. However, the spiritwalking berserker cannot see into, hear sounds from, or move through an area warded by an anti-magic shell or protection from evil spell or similar effect. The spiritwalking berserker is incorporeal and invisible, but can be detected with detect invisible or true seeing, harmed by spells and magic weapons if detected, and forced to return to his body with dispel evil. If the berserker’s body is destroyed, the character dies at the end of the spiritwalk. If the berserker’s spirit is destroyed, his body falls into a catatonic slumber that can only be lifted with restore life and limb, resurrection, or wish. Spiritwalking is so taxing that it can be performed but once per week.

### Chosen

*“My friend, it is in my heart that you were chosen by the Creator. That is our hope. Lord Foul taught Drool to do the summoning because he desired white gold. But Drool’s hands were on the Staff, not Lord Foul’s. The Despiser could not control who was summoned. So if you were chosen, you were chosen by the Creator…. The Creator believes your uncoerced volition and strength will save us in the end. If he is wrong, he has put the weapon of his own destruction into Lord Foul’s hands.”* - Lord Mhoram in The Illearth War (S.R. Donaldson) 

| Prime Requisite: | Lowest Ability Score
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | Any ability score 18
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Some men, whether out of desire for wealth, or fame, or power, or mere wanderlust, choose to be adventurers. But others are chosen, their paths guided by great powers toward heroic roads that lead them to everlasting glory—or ignominious death. A chosen can appear anywhere and at any time. The humblest farm boy is as likely to be marked by fate as the scion of a king. Chosen are, however, quite rare; fewer than 1 in 1,000 adventurers are chosen, and most people will live their entire lives without ever seeing one. When they do appear, they inevitably draw the attention of the great powers of light and darkness, ever ready to anoint a new champion or preemptively slay a new foe before he can come into the fullness of his power. 

To qualify as a chosen, a character must have at least one natural ability score of 18. The chosen’s prime requisite is his lowest ability score. Since a character must have an ability score of at least 9 in a class’s prime requisite(s) in order to choose a particular class, a character must have at least 9 in every ability score or he cannot become a chosen. A chosen must always be of Lawful alignment. A chosen who changes to Neutral or Chaotic alignment loses all his gifts. (At the Judge’s discretion, Chaotic chosen may be permitted, who work for the powers of darkness.)

Chosen are blessed with an instinctive natural aptitude for combat. At first level, chosen hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Whether from preternatural skill or uncanny link, chosen increase their base damage roll from successful melee and missile attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. A chosen can fight with a two-handed weapon, a weapon in each hand, or a weapon and shield, as desired.

Despite their talents, most chosen begin their adventuring careers with limited knowledge of arms and armor. Chosen may only wear hide or lighter armor, and may only fight with bolas, clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, nets, slings, saps, and staffs. However, a chosen may use one or more gifts (see below) to train in the use of better armor or weapons, either at 1st level or later. 


Every chosen receives gifts from the powers that have chosen him. Some gifts reveal themselves in overtly magical displays; other gifts may manifest as merely an instinctive aptitude for learning of particular skills, enabling the chosen to master in mere months what takes others a lifetime to learn.

At 1st level (Innocent), a chosen begins with three gifts. With each level of experienced gained thereafter, the number of gifts bestowed upon by the chosen increases, as shown on the Chosen Level Progression table. 

Just as each chosen has a different destiny, so each has a different set of gifts. Chosen select their gifts from the list below. All selections must be approved by the Judge. Some gifts may be banned from particular settings where they are inappropriate or where they refer to optional rules that the Judge has opted not to use. Chosen can only select the same gift multiple times at the same level with the Judge’s approval.


#### Chosen Gifts

*Armor Training:* The chosen trains to fight in armor. This gift may be selected multiple times. If selected once, the chosen can wear leather armor. If selected twice, the chosen can wear chain mail armor. If selected thrice, the chosen can wear plate armor.

*Aura of Protection:* The chosen gains a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. The chosen’s aura of protection appears as a golden halo when viewed with detect good, detect magic, or true seeing.

*Boon Companion:* Whenever an ally within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to allow the ally to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the ally can never re-roll a natural 1.

*Ceremonial Magic:* The chosen has learned the ceremonies of a particular tradition of ceremonial magic (antiquarian, liturgical, runic, sylvan, shamanic, or theurgical). The chosen must choose the tradition at the time he chooses the gift. When this gift is selected, the chosen becomes a 1st level ceremonialist with a repertoire of one 1st level ceremony. He can perform ceremonies in the tradition and create and use trinkets and talismans in the tradition as a 1st level ceremonialist, and can identify trinkets or talismans created by a ceremonialist of the tradition with a proficiency throw of 11+ and of other traditions with an 18+. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each subsequent time it is selected, the chosen can either reduce the proficiency throw required to identify trinkets and talismans of a tradition he already knows by 4; learn another tradition; add one ceremony (of any level he can perform) to his repertoire; or increase his ceremonialist caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of ceremonies. 

*Charismatic Ferocity:* When attacking with one-handed melee weapons or thrown weapons, the chosen may apply his CHA modifier instead of his STR modifier on his damage rolls.

*Chosen Weapon:* The chosen can designate a particular individual weapon as his chosen weapon. The chosen weapon must be given a name (e.g. “Excalibur” or “Anduril”). When the chosen wields his chosen weapon, it is treated as if its magical bonus to attack and damage were 1 point greater. This gift may be selected multiple times, but no more than once at 1st to 4th level, twice at 5th to 9th level, and thrice at 10th level and above. Each time it is selected the chosen can increase the bonus of his chosen weapon or designate an additional weapon as a chosen weapon.

*Cleansing Touch:* By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly remove a curse or dispel a harmful magical effect. The chosen must be of equal or greater level than the spellcaster who cast the curse or effect. 

*Courage:* The chosen has mastered his fear and will never shirk from his destiny. He is immune to normal and magical fear effects.

*Destined:* The chosen gains two Fate Points. This gift may be selected multiple times.

*Determined:* The chosen may spend a Fate Point after making an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw to set the result of the throw to 10 (instead of re-rolling). The chosen cannot spend a Fate Point in this manner if the original roll was a natural 1, however. 

*Divine Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Divine Blessing, Divine Health, Laying on Hands, Prophecy, and Sensing Evil. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.

*Eldritch Talent:* The chosen manifests the ability to cast an eldritch spell at certain intervals. The spell selected may be of any level, up to the chosen’s level of experience. The spell is cast as if the chosen were of the minimum caster level for the spell. The frequency with which the chosen can cast is determined by the spells’ level. 1st – once per hour; 2nd – once per 8 hours; 3rd – once per day; 4th – once per week; 5th – once per month; 6th – once per year.  The chosen does not have a spellbook and cannot change his repertoire. This gift does not allow the chosen to use scrolls or magic items usable only by mages or clerics. This proficiency can be selected multiple times to gain the ability to cast additional spells. (In traditional ACKS campaigns, arcane or divine magic can be substituted for eldritch magic.)

*Eldritch Warrior:* When the chosen successfully strikes a target with a melee attack, he can expend a spell to increase damage. Damage is increased by 1d6 per level of the spell expended. The chosen must have gained spellcasting abilities from the Eldritch Talent gift before selecting this gift.

*Farseeing:* The chosen can see the fates of mortals. He may determine how many Fate Points a character has after 10 minutes (1 turn) of casual interaction or observation. Once per week, the chosen may cast fate (as the spell) with a casting time of 10 minutes (1 turn).

*Friends of Birds and Beasts:* The chosen can understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character). This gives the chosen a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals, and allows him to take animals as henchmen. The chosen can also identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+. 

*Gift of Tongues:* The chosen has a gift for learning new tongues. Each time this gift is selected, he may learn four additional languages.

*Hard to Kill:* When a chosen is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply.  The chosen also subtract his class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.

*Healing Touch:* By touching a creature and spending a Fate Point, the chosen can instantly heal the creature by an amount equal to his Base Healing Rate or the creature’s Base Healing Rate, whichever is less.

*Inspiring:* By reciting heroic lays or stirring words for a few moments before a battle (one round), a chosen can grant his allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the character), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A chosen can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level.  A chosen cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

*Invulnerable:* The chosen is blessed with partial invulnerability  to harm. Any damage the chosen suffers from non-magical attacks is reduced by 1 point per die. The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity. This gift can be selected up to three times. Each additional time the gift is selected, damage suffered is reduced by 1 additional point per die, to a maximum of 3 points per die.

*Lion-Hearted:* If the chosen is serving as a commander or hero on the battlefield with an army, the army automatically stands firm on its first morale roll, or rallies if it would have stood firm. This benefit is lost for the duration of the battle, however, if the chosen himself routs, flees, or leads from the rear (see Domains at War: Battles, p. XX).

*Lucky:* When re-rolling attack throws, proficiency throws, or saving throws using Fate Points, the chosen may roll the die twice and choose the better value.

*Keen Eyes:* The chosen can detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection.

*Magical Music:* The chosen gains the ability to sing spells. He gets two spell points and has one 1st level eldritch spell in his repertoire, which he casts as a 1st level spellsinger. This gift can be selected multiple times. Each time the gif its selected, the character can either increase his caster level by two, up to a maximum of his class level; or gain two spell points and add one additional eldritch spell (of any level he can spellsing) to his repertoire. Spells learned from other gifts (such as Eldritch Talent) are not included in the chosen’s repertoire of spellsinging spells. 

*Magical Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alchemy, Arcane Dabbling, Battle Magic, Collegiate Wizardry, Elementalism, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Prestidigitation, Quiet Magic, Sensing Power, Soothsaying, Transmogrification, or Unflappable Casting. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. Note that some proficiencies available with this gift are not useful unless the chosen has selected the Eldritch Talent gift.

*Martial Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Alertness, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery, Fighting Style, Precise Shooting, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. 

*Martial Talent:* The chosen has a native aptitude for weapons. The chosen gains a +1 bonus to attack throws with his choice of either melee or missile attacks. This gift can be selected twice, once for melee and once for missile attacks.

*Martial Training:* The chosen has had training in use of arms. This gift may be selected multiple times. Each time it is selected, choose one of the following types of weapons and add these to the list of weapons permitted to the character: (1) axes; (2) bows/crossbows; (3) flails/hammers/maces; (4) swords/daggers; (5) spears/pole arms; (6) any four weapons.

*Meditative Focus:* The chosen can go into a state of intense Zen-like focus once per day per level of experience. While in focus, the character gains a +1 bonus to all attack throws, proficiency throws, saving throws, and initiative rolls. A meditative focus lasts for 1 turn (10 minutes).

*Military Genius:* The chosen commands the battlefield like a god of war. He gains a permanent +1 bonus to his strategic ability, leadership ability, and morale modifier when commanding troops on the battlefield. 

*Mystical Bloodline:* The chosen is the scion of an otherworldly or inhuman power. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s lifespan is extend to three times longer than normal, and he ceases to show further signs of aging. He also gains the elf’s immunity to paralysis. When this gift is selected, the chosen’s ancestry manifests somehow in his appearance (pointed ears, golden eyes, a strange birthmark, or other unusual trait.)

*Scion of Kings:* The blood of ancient lords flows in the chosen’s veins. The character may hire one more henchman than his Charisma would otherwise permit, and the base morale score of any henchmen is increased by 1.  

*Second Sight:* The chosen has a connection to the hidden world, and can see innately or magically invisible creatures within 60’. Invisible creatures are aware that the chosen can see them, and may often take a particular interest in him as a result. Second Sight does not provide the ability to see characters hiding in shadows, secret doors, traps, or other creatures or objects hidden through cover and concealment, but does provide a +4 bonus to saving throws to disbelieve illusions.  

*Student of War:* The chosen can select one proficiency, choosing Command, Military Strategy, Leadership, or Siege Engineering. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency or proficiency rank each time.

*Sworn Foe:* When this gift is selected, the chosen must designate one specific individual monster or NPC by its name or unique physical characteristic (e.g. “the six-fingered man”). That creature becomes his sworn foe. The chosen gains a +2 bonus to attack throws and saving throws when confronting his sworn foe. If the chosen lands a successful attack on his sworn foe (including spells), the chosen can spend a Fate Point to deal double damage with the attack. If the sworn foe lands a successful attack on the chosen, the chosen can spend a Fate Point to halve the damage dealt by the attack. Once a chosen defeats his sworn foe, he may name a new sworn foe at any time thereafter. A sworn foe must have at least equal HD or levels of experience than the chosen; if the chosen ever surpasses his sworn foe in level or HD, he must select a new foe.

*Thievery Proficiency:* The chosen can select one class proficiency, choosing from Acrobatics, Alertness, Ambushing, Cat Burglary, Climbing, Contortionism, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading, Lockpicking, Passing Without Trace, Running, Skulking, and Trap Finding. This gift can be selected multiple times, selecting an additional proficiency each time, to a maximum limit of three selections. 

*Thievery Training:* The chosen can select one thief skill, choosing from Find Traps, Hide in Shadows, Move Silently, Open Locks, Pick Pockets, and Remove Traps. Thereafter the chosen can perform this skill as a thief of his level. This proficiency may be selected multiple times to gain additional thief skills, to a maximum limit of three selections. 

*Tribulating Adversary:* Whenever an enemy within 30’ makes an attack throw, proficiency throw, or saving throw, the chosen may spend a Fate Point to force the enemy to re-roll the throw. The chosen can spend additional Fate Points to allow further re-rolls if desired. However, the chosen can never force a re-roll of a natural 20.

*Wholeness of Body:* The chosen is immune to all forms of poison, including magical poisons.

When a chosen reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his sense of destiny inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the chosen gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the chosen’s Charisma, proficiencies, or class powers.

At 9th level (Chosen), a chosen can establish a stronghold and become a protector of men. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries.

Chosen Proficiency List: Alertness, Arcane Dabbling, Armor Training, Beast Friendship, Blind Fighting, Combat Reflexes, Combat Trickery (force back, overrun, sunder), Command, Diplomacy, Divine Blessing, Endurance, Farseeing*, Fighting Style, Goblin-Slaying, Healing, Laying on Hands, Leadership, Military Strategy, Mystic Aura, Passing Without Trace, Prophecy*, Running, Second Sight*, Skirmishing, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*

### Ecclesiastic 

*Armed with holy water and aspergillus, and accompanied by many of the towns-people carrying torches, staves and halberds, the priest was led by Maspier to the place of the horror; and there they had found the body of Mazzal, with fearfully mangled face, and throat and bosom lined with bloody lacerations. The demoniac assailant had flown, and it was not seen or encountered again that night; but those who had beheld its work returned aghast to their homes, feeling that a creature of nethermost hell had come to visit the city, and perchance to abide therein. Consternation was rife on the morrow, when the story became generally known; and rites of exorcism against the invading demon were performed by the clergy in all public places and before thresholds.* – The Maker of Gargoyles (C. A. Smith)

Ecclesiastics are human men and women dedicated to the service of a religious order. If your Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default ecclesiastic is assumed to be a member of the Temple of the Winged Sun, devoted to Ammonar, God of Law and Light. Whatever order they serve, the majority of ecclesiastics never adventure, preferring to dedicate themselves to ministry, prayer, and sacramental duties. Only a few venture forth from their parishes into the dangers of the world, traveling as mendicants, proselytizers, missionaries, or crusaders. Most of these ecclesiastics lose their lives or their faith to darkness or decadence. Those ecclesiastics who succeed in bringing the light of faith into dark places are recorded by later generations as saints and prophets of their god.
Ecclesiastics receive little combat training. At first level, ecclesiastics hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), but they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. as clerics). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, or darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. 
Although they cannot cast spells like clerics, ecclesiastics may learn and perform eldritch ceremonies in the liturgical tradition starting at 1st level (Acolyte). An ecclesiastic’s selection of ceremonies is limited to the ceremonies in his repertoire. An ecclesiastic’s repertoire can include a number of eldritch ceremonies up to the number and level of ceremonies listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. More information on ceremonial magic, and individual spell descriptions, can be found in the [Heroic Magic](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-heroic-magic) chapter.

As they advance in level, ecclesiastics may add new ceremonies to their repertoire by visiting a temple of their order and spending one game week per ceremony. Each ecclesiastic’s order will require that the ecclesiastic learn particular ceremonies at each level, and will refuse to teach certain ceremonies it deems sacrilegious. Ecclesiastics who wish to learn such ceremonies must find or research them on their own. The specific ceremonies taught by any given order should be determined by the Judge based on his setting. 

EXAMPLE: Balbus, an ecclesiastic, has advanced to 2nd level, increasing his repertoire from one to two 1st level ceremonies. He visits the local Temple of the Winged Sun and impudently inquires of his Patriarch whether he might learn choking grip or weave smoke. After a stern lecture on upholding Light and Law, Balbus is offered a choice of illumination or command word.  

Ecclesiastics must uphold the doctrines of their faith in order to remain members of their religious order. If an ecclesiastic is found breaking the rules of his order, he may be disciplined or even separated from his order. An ecclesiastic who is separated from his order may not return to the order when they advance in level to learn new ceremonies, and will not receive aid or followers when building a cathedral (see below). Other penalties are entirely up to the Judge.

Ecclesiastics are among the most educated and respected members of their society. All ecclesiastics learn theology at a seminary or monastery (as per the Theology proficiency). They can automatically identify religious symbols, spell signatures, trappings, and holy days of their own faith, and can recognize those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 11+. Rare or occult cults may be harder to recognize (Judge’s discretion). An ecclesiastic may select additional ranks in the Theology proficiency to improve his proficiency throw if desired. 

Ecclesiastics can comfort and console the wounded, helping the faithful to better endure pain and suffering while they heal. Each use of the ability requires 1 turn (10 minutes), during which the target creature is reassured through prayer and pastoral guidance. Once comforted and consoled, the creature’s base healing rate from resting is doubled for the next day. An ecclesiastic cannot comfort and console wounded creatures of a different alignment or religion, nor can he comfort and console creatures of animal intelligence. This ability only applies to healing from resting. It does not stack with the effects of the salving rest spell nor with rallying the faithful.
By reciting a sermon or singing a hymn of battle, an ecclesiastics can rally the faithful. Rallying the faithful requires  a few moments of oration (one round), and grants allied creatures within 30’ a pool of temporary hit points equal to the lower of the ecclesiastic’s or the subject’s base healing rate. These temporary hit points last for one turn (10 minutes) or until lost to damage, whichever comes first. To benefit from this spell, the subjects must either be of the same alignment and religion of the ecclesiastic, or must have personally benefited from his magic in the past. An ecclesiastic can rally the faithful once per day per level.  
 
EXAMPLE: Balbus, now a 5th level ecclesiastic, has a base healing rate of 1d8. He is adventuring with Athelstan (a paladin with 12 hp and a base healing rate of 1d4) and Raknar Red-Handed (a barbarian with 17 hp and a base healing rate of 1d6). The adventurers confront an ogre, which hits Raknar for 8 points of damage, reducing him to 9 hp. On his action, Balbus rallies the faithful, granting Athelstan and Balbus temporary hit points. Each character receives the temporary hit points equal to the lower of Balbus’ or their own base healing rate; for both characters that is their own healing rate. Athelstan rolls 1d4 and receives 2 temporary hit points, putting him at 12 hp and 2 temporary hp. Balbus rolls 1d6 and receives 6 temporary hp, putting him at 9 (of 17) hp and 6 temporary hp. These temporary hp will be lost first if the adventurers are hit. Otherwise they will last one turn.

Finally, all ecclesiastics have the ability to turn undead, calling upon the liturgy of their faith to drive back, and even destroy, undead. The potency of this ability is determined by level. On the Turning Undead table, there will be a dash, a “T”, a “D”, or a number corresponding to the type of undead monster and the level of the ecclesiastic. A dash means that the ecclesiastic has not attained high enough level to turn the undead type. A “T” means that the ecclesiastic automatically turns the undead, and a “D” means that the undead will be destroyed automatically. A number indicates that the player must roll that number or higher on 1d20 in order to turn the undead. If this roll is successful, or there is a “T” in the chart, the player rolls 2d6 and the result equals the number of total Hit Dice of undead monsters turned. A “D” in the chart requires the same roll to determine how many HD of undead are destroyed. No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead monster will always be turned or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful use of turning. 

Turned undead flee the area for 10 rounds by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. If the ecclesiastic attacks turned undead in melee combat, the turning effect is broken, but he can use spells or missile weapons against them, and other characters may attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect. Destroyed undead are immediately turned to ash. 

There is no limit to how often an ecclesiastic may attempt to turn undead each day, but if an attempt to turn undead fails during an encounter, the ecclesiastic may not attempt to turn undead again for the remainder of that encounter.

Certain chaotic sects teach their ecclesiastics to control undead rather than turn them. The undead are controlled for 1 turn per level of the character. If the undead would have been destroyed, the undead are controlled for 1 day per level of the ecclesiastic instead. Controlled undead behave as if charmed, obeying the ecclesiastic as if they were friends. However, if the controlled undead are turned or destroyed by an ecclesiastic during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee (as if turned).


An ecclesiastic can use any magic items usable by mages or clerics. When an ecclesiastic reaches 5th level (Vicar), he may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. Ecclesiastics may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research. 
 
At 9th level (Patriarch), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. Also upon attaining 9th level (Patriarch), an ecclesiastic may establish or build a cathedral. So long as the ecclesiastic is currently a member in good standing of his order, he may buy or build his cathedral at half the normal price due to aid from his order. Once a cathedral is established, the ecclesiastic’s reputation will spread and he will attract 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 ecclesiastics of 1st-3rd level of the same religion to serve the order. They are completely loyal (morale +4). While in the ecclesiastic’s service, his followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. The Judge determines which proportions of followers are archers, infantry, etc. Ecclesiastic’s cathedrals are otherwise identical to cleric’s fortified temples, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.

At 11th level, an ecclesiastic may learn and cast ritual eldritch pells of great power (6th and 7th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breads. If chaotic, the ecclesiastic will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead himself.

### Elven Spellsinger

*In that hour Lúthien came, and standing upon the bridge that led to Sauron’s isle she sang a song that no walls of stone could hinder. Beren heard, and he thought that he dreamed; for the stars shone above him, and in the trees nightingales were singing. And in answer he sang a song of challenge… Then all strength left him and he fell down into darkness. But Lúthien heard his answering voice, and she sang then a song of greater power. The wolves howled, and the isle trembled.* – Of Beren and Lúthien, The Silmarillion (J.R.R. Tolkien)

According to elven myth, the world began with a song – a mighty anthem sung by the gods themselves by which all things were created. Whether this myth is true, not even the wisest sages can say; but it is true that elf-song can carry great magical power, through which the world can be re-made in accordance with the will of the singer. Elves who have mastered this art are known as spellsingers, and they are counted among the mightiest of magicians. Though most elven spellsingers live out their long lives in the high fastnesses of their people, some enter the realms of men, called forth by a desire to experience awe and terror, a quest for rare and forgotten magic, or merely the lure of adventure. 

Elven spellsingers receive limited combat training. At first level, spellsingers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages), though they advance in saving throws by two points every four levels (i.e. as clerics). They may fight with daggers, swords, short swords, composite bows, long bows, and quarterstaffs. They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed but are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor.  

The voices of all elves sound lilting and lyrical to the ears of men; that of the spellsinger is beautiful enough to work magic. Every elven spellsinger begins with one rank of Perform (singing) proficiency; additional ranks may be accumulated as class or general proficiency selections. Because of her irresistible voice, an elven spellsinger gains a +2 bonus to reaction rolls with creatures she speaks to. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if charmed while in her presence. Creatures with a WIS greater than the spellsinger’s CHA are immune to this power (and the elven spellsinger will know they are immune).

All elven spellsingers practice the art of spellsinging from which they derive their name. Spellsinging is a method of casting eldritch spells by reciting lyrics laced with words of power. Spellsingers perform magic by spending spell points (SP)  rather than by expending daily spell castings. Each spell costs a certain number of spell points to sing. The higher the level of the spell, the more points it costs. The Spell Point Costs table describes each spell’s cost.  The spellsingers’ use of spell points gives them the flexibility to choose to cast a large number of low level spells, a small number of high level spells, or any combination in between. See p. XX of the Heroic Magic chapter for details on spellsinging. 

| Spell Level | Spell Point Cost |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| 1st         | 1           |
| 2nd         |	2           |
| 3rd         |	3           |
| 4th         |	5           |
| 5th         |	7           |
| 6th         |	10          |

Spellsingers recover their spell points in the same way spellcasters recover their daily spell castings, by spending eight hours resting without interruption and one hour concentrating on prayer or study. Spell points can only be recovered by resting once every 24 hours. Spellsingers can also tap ambient magic to fuel their spells without expending their own SPs. See p. XX of the Heroic Magic chapter for details on tapping ambient magic.

Like other eldritch casters, a spellsinger’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A spellsinger’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus, and functions exactly like an arcane/eldritch caster’s repertoire in all respects. Unlike other casters, however, spellsingers can cast spells that are not in their repertoire by extemporaneously singing spells. See p. XX of the Heroic Magic chapter for details on extemporaneous spellsinging. 

When an elven spellsinger reaches 5th level (Spellbinder), she may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. Elven spellsingers may collect and use divine power as clerics in order to fuel their magical research. When an elven spellsinger reaches 9th level (Spellsinger), she is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. 

At 9th level, an elven spellsinger can also establish a fastness in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen. Rather than impose upon nature, this keep must blend seamlessly with it. A total of 3d6x10 1st level elven NPCs will move in to help with it and defend the fastness at no cost to the character. Additional rules for elven fastnesses are detailed in the Campaign chapter of ACKS.

At 11th level, an elven spellsinger may learn and cast ritual spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the spellsinger may create necromantic servants and become undead, though such a choice is understandably rarer among the ageless elves. 

Like other elves, spellsingers gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells are reduced by 1. (These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the table below.) All elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

### Freebooter

*They lived by thievery, robbery, bodyguarding, brief commissions as couriers and agents—commissions they always, or almost always, fulfilled punctiliously—and by showmanship, the Mouser entertaining by legerdemain, juggling, and buffoonery, while Fafhrd with his gift for tongues and training as a singing skald excelled at minstrelsy. They never worked as cooks, clerks, carpenters, tree-fellers, or common servants...*  – The Circle Curse, in Swords Against Death (Fritz Leiber)

Freebooters are a motley assortment of adventurers who live and die for plunder. Some freebooters are dauntless expeditionaries who raid tombs for ancient treasures. Others may be brutal ruffians who rob and ravage the weak and foolish, cunning scoundrels with the charisma to convince their marks to hand over their wealth willingly, or hardy wayfarers who exact a toll on any who cross the roads and trails of their wilderness homes. Whatever their particular path to plunder, wayfarers share a lust for adventure, a taste for gold, and a willingness to resort to subterfuge and backhanded tactics without hesitation.  

Like thieves, freebooters often belong to a criminal guild which offers shelter and information between heists. At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. In the Auran Empire, freebooters are everywhere, from the slums of the ports of Kushtu to the highest halls of the Senate in Aura. 

Freebooters are ruthless, dirty combatants. At first level, freebooters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws by two points every three levels of experience. However they advance in saving throws like thieves, by two points every four levels of experience. 

All freebooters may wear leather armor or lighter, and may wield crossbows, daggers, shortbows, short swords, and swords, as well as five other weapons determined by their path (see below). They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed and wielding a weapon in each hand, but may not use shields.  They may only use magic items usable by thieves.

Lacking the staying power of fighters, freebooters prefer to strike from ambush and finish their foes quickly. A freebooter whose opponent is unaware of his presence can backstab him. When backstabbing, the freebooter receives an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deals additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A freebooter at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage. 

Freebooters increase their damage from their choice of either missile or melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. The freebooter must choose which type of attack will receive the damage bonus at 1st level, and may not change the choice as he advances (i.e. they may choose to be either melee or missile specialists). 

A freebooter’s plundering pursuits are shaped by his path to wealth. There are four paths to wealth available to a freebooter: Expeditionary, Ruffian, Scoundrel, and Wayfarer. Each path offers a different set of abilities reflecting that path’s preferred methods to accumulate wealth. When a freebooter is created, select a path for the character from the Paths to Wealth table below, and write down the proficiencies and powers of the path. Each path teaches the use of a selection of five additional weapons, trains the character in four thief skills, and grants five bonus proficiencies. Note that each path has its own prime requisite in addition to DEX.

| Path | Description
| :--- | :----------
| Expeditionary	| A looter of tombs and a delver of dungeons, skilled in scouting, trap-finding, and lock-picking.
| Ruffian | A cut-throat and killer, skilled in breaking and entering, robbery, and intimidation.
| Scoundrel | A gentleman thief, skilled in subterfuge and disguise.
| Wayfarer | A highwayman, outrider, or scout, skilled in hunting, trapping, and survival. 

At the Judge’s discretion, a freebooter may follow a unique path, outside of the four listed above. The player and Judge should collaborate to choose five weapons, four thief skills, and five bonus proficiencies that are appropriate to the freebooter.

**Path of Expeditionary**<br>
Prime Requisite: WIS<br>
Weapons:  hand axe, pole arm, spear, staff, war hammer<br>
Thief Skills:  find traps, open locks, move silently, remove traps<br>
Bonus Proficiencies:  Alertness, Climbing, Dungeon Bashing, Mapping, Trap Finding


The expeditionary is a looter of tombs and a delver of dungeons. He often serves as point-man on dungeon delves due to his ability to find both secret doors and traps more effectively than almost any other adventurer. His ability to climb walls and move silently allows him to scout ahead undetected by listening guards, while his training in disarming traps, opening locks, and bashing doors enables him to penetrate almost any obstacle in his path to plunder. Expeditionaries are also excellent map-makers and most treasure maps are created by them.

**Path of Ruffian**
Prime Requisite: STR 
Weapons: battle axe, club, morning star, sap, whip
Thief Skills: hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets
Bonus Proficiencies: Dungeon Bashing, Fighting Style (ruffian’s choice), Intimidation, Skulking, Swashbuckling

The ruffian is a cut-throat and killer. A ruffian can cut the purses of passersby, skulk in the shadows to waylay unsuspecting victims, break into homes and burglarize their valuables, or simply rely on his threatening demeanor and martial prowess to rob victims at sword-point. Most freebooters are ruffians, and they can be found in great numbers in any den of scum and villainy.

**Path of Scoundrel**
Prime Requisite: CHA
Weapons: arbalest, dart, mace, sap, whip
Thief Skills: hide in shadows, move silently, open locks, pick pockets
Bonus Proficiencies: Cat Burglary, Climbing, Disguise, Eavesdropping, Lip Reading

The scoundrel is a gentleman thief. His ability to scale walls, open locks, hide in shadows, and move silently enables him to function as nigh-undetectable cat burglar, stealing his victims’ most precious treasures without need for violence. An expert in disguise, he can blend in to any crowd, where his graceful sleight-of-hand can relieve his marks of their important papers and burdensome purses. Skilled eavesdroppers and lip readers, scoundrels often work as spies and secret agents, uncovering secrets that the powerful wish to keep hidden.

**Path of Wayfarer**
Prime Requisite: CON
Weapons: bola, hand axe, longbow, net, staff
Thief Skills: climb walls, hear noise, hide in shadows, move silently
Bonus Proficiencies: Land Surveying, Running, Sniping, Skirmishing, Tracking

The wayfarer is a highwayman, outrider, and scout. He excels at hit-and-run attacks, sniping from the cover of darkness and brush, then falling back swiftly and silently into the wilderness. He has the ability to move through the wilderness at great speed, and can navigate mountainous terrain, climb trees, and scale precipices that halt pursuers. If inclined to law, wayfarers may use their expertise in tracking and land surveying to discover monster lairs in the wilderness for adventuring parties or local garrisons.

## Core Classes


### Fighter

| Prime Requisite: | STR
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d8
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Fighters are exclusively trained in the arts of combat and war. They are specialists at dealing physical blows. Fighters may have learned their arts as warriors, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. Fighters are trained in the use of all weapons and armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, or wielding a weapon in each hand, as desired. At first level, fighters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (the best progression of any class). Fighters also increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

When a fighter reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his battlefield prowess inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter's Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Warlord), a fighter can, assuming enough gold is at hand, build a castle and become a great leader of men, taking a leadership rank in his society. When he does so, up 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 fighters of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Through force of arms, the fighter may ultimately control several castles or even entire realms, but must be a capable, strong leader and provide protection. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Mage

| Prime Requisite: | INT
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Sometimes called wizards, sorcerers, or magicians, mages study arcane secrets and cast spells. While early in their career mages have only limited power, experienced mages are able to cast a great number of powerful spells. A mage may be a wizard steeped in ancient lore, a sinister sorcerer, or a village witch or hedge wizard with strange charms and hodge-podge traditions.

Because of their devotion to arcane study, mages receive limited combat training. At first level, mages hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., half as fast as fighters). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, and darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. For these reasons, mages are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

In exchange for these weaknesses, mages can learn and cast many powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the mage can use in a single day are listed on the [Mage Spell Progression](Chapter02.md#mage-level-and-spell-progression) table. A mage's spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A mage's repertoire can include a number of spells up to to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. For instance, Quintus, a 3rd level mage, is able to cast 2 1st level spells and 1 2nd level spell per day. If he has 16 INT (+2 modifier) he can have up to 4 1st level and 3 2nd level spells in his repertoire. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter.

When a mage reaches 5th level (Thaumaturge), he may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. When a mage reaches 9th level (Wizard), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A mage may also build a sanctum, often a great tower, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal men seeking to become mages. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the mage's service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the mage builds a dungeon beneath or near his tower, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for mages' sanctum are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 11th level, a mage may learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the mage may create necromantic servants and become undead. These rules are in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Cleric

| Prime Requisite: | WIS
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Clerics are holy crusaders, trained to fight to further the ends of their faith. Humans who become clerics have pledged their lives to serve a particular deity or religion. To this end, they conduct their lives in a way that furthers the desires and will of their gods or goddesses. A cleric may be a priest-militant, a cultist sworn to the chthonic powers of the Nether Darkness, or anything in between.

Clerics are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. At first level, clerics hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (a progression mid-way between fighters and mages). As holy warriors, clerics are trained to wear any armor and fight with a variety of weapons. The particular weapons that clerics are trained to fight with are determined by the strictures of their religious order.

If your Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default cleric is assumed to be a worshipper of the God of Law and Light. Strict holy doctrine prevents these clerics from using any weapons that shed blood. The cleric of Law and Light may use only blunt weapons such as warhammers, maces, clubs, quarterstaffs, and slings. This cleric may use any shields or fight with two-handed weapons, but is not trained to fight with weapons in each hand (i.e. he may not 'dual wield'). (See the [bladedancer campaign class](Chapter02.md#bladedancer) for an example of a cleric variant with a different feel).

All clerics have the ability to turn undead, calling upon the name and power of their deity to turn away, and even destroy, undead. The potency of this ability is determined by level. On the [Turning Undead](Chapter02.md#cleric-turning-undead-by-cleric-level) table, there will be a dash, a "T", a "D", or a number corresponding to the type of undead monster and the level of the cleric. A dash means that the cleric has not attained high enough level to turn the undead type. A "T" means that the cleric automatically turns the undead, and a "D" means that the undead will be destroyed automatically. A number indicates that the player must roll that number or higher on 1d20 in order to turn the undead. If this roll is successful, or there is a "T" in the chart, the player rolls 2d6 and the result equals the number of total Hit Dice of undead monsters turned. A "D" in the chart requires the same roll to determine how many HD of undead are destroyed. No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead monster will always be turned or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful use of turning.

There is no limit to how often a cleric may attempt to turn undead each day, but if an attempt to turn undead fails during an encounter, the cleric may not attempt to turn undead again for the remainder of that encounter.

*Example*: Balbus the Blessed, a 1st level cleric, attempts to turn 4 foul undead skeletons. When Balbus's player looks at the [Turning Undead](Chapter02.md#cleric-turning-undead-by-cleric-level) table, the value corresponding to his level and the entry for skeletons is 10+. He will turn some undead on a roll of 10 or higher on 1d20. He rolls a result of 12, meaning some skeletons will be turned. To determine how many HD he turns, he rolls 2d6 and comes up with a 3. Since skeletons have 1 HD each, three of them flee, leaving one behind for Balbus to vanquish.

If Balbus had been attempting to turn zombies, or other undead that have 2 HD each, he would only have turned one, since a roll of three only completely accounts for one 2 HD monster.

Turned undead flee the area for 10 rounds by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. If the cleric attacks turned undead in melee combat, the turning effect is broken, but he can use spells or missile weapons against them, and other characters may attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect. Destroyed undead are immediately turned to ash.

Certain chaotic sects teach their clerics to control undead rather than turn them. The undead are controlled for 1 turn per level of the cleric. If the undead would have been destroyed, the undead are controlled for 1 day per level of the cleric instead. Controlled undead behave as if charmed, obeying the cleric as if they were friends. However, if the controlled undead are turned or destroyed by a cleric during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee (as if turned).

Starting at 2nd level (Acolyte), clerics may manifest their deity's power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The power and number of divine spells available to the character are determined by level according to the [Cleric Spell Progression](Chapter02.md#cleric-level-and-spell-progression) table. See the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for a list of all available spells.

In order to use spells and turn undead, clerics must uphold the doctrines of their faith and god. If a cleric ever falls from favor, due to violating the beliefs of his god or breaking the rules of his clergy, the god may impose penalties upon the cleric. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge, but might include penalties to attack or a reduction in spells available. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter.

When a cleric reaches 5th level (Vicar), he may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Patriarch), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a cleric may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the cleric will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead himself. These activities are explained in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

Upon attaining 9th level (Patriarch), a cleric may establish or build a fortified church. So long as the cleric is currently in favor with his god, he may buy or build his fortified church at half the normal price due to divine intervention. Once a fortified church is established, the cleric's reputation will spread and he will attract 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 clerics of 1st-3rd level of the same religion to serve the order. They are completely loyal (morale +4). While in the cleric's service, his followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. The Judge determines which proportions of followers are archers, infantry, etc. Additional rules for fortified churches are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Thief

| Prime Requisite: | DEX
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Thieves have a range of unique skills associated with their profession that make them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves can be a bit shady and they sometimes are not as trustworthy as other classes. A thief will usually belong to a Thieves' Guild from the character's local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. At the Judge's discretion, a thief may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. Thieves are everywhere, from the slums to the highest halls of the government.

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first level, thieves hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. Because of their need for stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands.

A thief also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the thief will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A thief at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.

Thieves have the following range of skills, which improve as the thief gains levels according to the progression on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table. When a thief attempts to make use of one of his skills, the character or Judge will make a proficiency throw of 1d20. (Usually the Judge will make rolls for these abilities, because a thief is not always aware when he has failed.) After applying any relevant modifiers (e.g. due to the complexity of a lock), the result is compared to the target value listed on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table below for the appropriate skill. A result that is greater than or equal to the value listed for the proficiency throw that corresponds to the thief's level is a success. A roll of 20 is always a success, and a roll of 1 is always a failure.

**Opening Locks**: With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief may pick mechanical locks. He may only try to pick a particular lock once, and if he fails, he may not try the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the lock.

**Finding and Removing Traps**: Through careful inspection and probing, a thief may find hidden traps and then attempt to disable or discharge the trap harmlessly. A thief may only try to find or remove a trap once in any given area. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the trap. If the thief fails, he may not try again until he reaches a higher experience level. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he can remove it.

**Picking Pockets**: This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves for it is a quick source of income - though not without peril. A throw that is less than half the target value means that the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim's reaction.

**Moving Silently**: Thieves may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Thieves may move silently at  1/2  their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than  1/2  speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.

**Climbing Walls**: Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Thieves climb at  1/4  their standard combat movement rate.

**Hiding in Shadows**: A thief may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A thief will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.

**Hearing Noises**: Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway and at a door or other locations. The thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment.

Upon attaining 4th level, a thief gains the ability to read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a thief attains 9th level (Master Thief), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. A successful character might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, a thief can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

### Assassin

| :--------------- | :----------

| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Assassins are humans who train to kill by ambush and treachery. Assassins may be back-alley brawlers, violent thugs, or members of an organized guild. Some assassins are members of an order of Assassins, a religious brotherhood of trained killers, or are simply murders-for-hire or rogues with a taste for violence.

Assassins are expert combatants, though lacking somewhat in toughness (hit points). At first level, assassins hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. Assassins increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

Assassins may use any weapon without limitation. Although assassins generally prefer fast, concealable, or quiet weapons, killing can occur under many circumstances. They may fight using a weapon two-handed, a weapon in each hand, or a weapon and shield.

Assassins may wear any type of armor, but most favor stealth over steel. When wearing leather armor or lighter garb, an assassin may move silently, hide in shadows, and backstab as a thief of the same level. If wear armor heavier than leather, these abilities are not available.

Upon reaching 9th level (Assassin), an assassin may construct a hideout. When an assassin builds a hideout, he will gain 2d6 1st level assassin apprentices, come to learn under a master. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These thugs will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the assassin's local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Bard

| Prime Requisite: | DEX and CHA
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Successful adventurers live forever in the sagas and songs about their deeds. Remembering and recounting these sagas is the profession of bards. Most bards are content to recite the deeds of others, but some bold few participate in the dangers themselves and become inspiring heroes in their own right. A bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald, or haughty aristocrat.

Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws as a thief, by two points every four levels of experience. At first level, bards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wield a weapon in each hand if desired. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields.

All bards can sing, recite poetry, or play a group of instruments in a skilled manner. The bard chooses the type of performance that his character knows. A bard may take the Perform proficiency to learn other types of performances (see [Chapter 4, Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies)).

By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires  a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the bard's allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring epic gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

Because of their study of ancient annals and legends, bards possess loremastery. This knowledge allows them to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a bard must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in these tasks. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level.

This same knowledge allows bards to dabble in the arcane. They may attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic Items only useable by mages. At 1st level, the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge's discretion). The proficiency throw required reduces by 2 per level, to a minimum of 3+.

Upon attaining 4th level (Annalist), the bard gains the ability to read languages, including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings. A proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20 is required. If the roll does not succeed, the bard may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a bard reaches 5th level (Chronicler), his chronicles of battle inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the bard is there to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard's Charisma or proficiencies.

Upon reaching 9th level (Bard), a bard can build a hall and become a ruler. When he does so, up 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 bards of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Additional rules for halls are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, the bard can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

### Bladedancer

| Prime Requisite: | WIS and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Bladedancers are human women who have dedicated themselves to the service of a goddess of war. They belong to military clerical orders, where they are trained in fighting and casting spells. Most bladedancers are trained to the art from a young age at the Temples of the Goddess of Love and War. A fully trained bladedancer is highly coveted as a bodyguard and escort by the great noble houses.

Bladedancers are skilled combatants. At first level, bladedancers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance like clerics in attack throws and saving throws, by two points every four levels of experience. By religious doctrine, bladedancers are forbidden from debasing themselves with the fighting implements of the peasantry, or dishonorably firing missiles from a distance. A bladedancer may only use piercing and slashing melee weapons, such as daggers, swords, spears, and polearms. This eliminates weapons such as clubs, maces, and warhammers, as well as bows, slings, and crossbows.

A bladedancer may wield a weapon in each hand, or fight with a two-handed weapon, but may not resort to shields. Bladedancers are only trained to fight in leather or lighter armor. However, they gain a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to Armor Class if able to move freely. At level 7, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 the AC bonus increases to +3.

A bladedancer may turn undead like a cleric. Starting at 2nd level, a bladedancer may cast divine spells. Bladedancers follow the same spell progression as clerics and use the same rules for learning and casting spells. However, a bladedancer's spell list is slightly different than a cleric's; see the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for details. Like clerics, bladedancers must uphold the doctrines of their faith and god, and suffer penalties if they violate them.

When a bladedancer reaches 5th level (Blade-Sister), she may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Blade-Mistress), she is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a bladedancer may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the bladedancer will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead herself. These activities are explained in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

When a bladedancer reaches 9th level (Blade-Mistress), she may choose to construct a temple as a stronghold. If she has not lost the favor of her deity, the cost of building the temple will be half the normal amount due to miraculous assistance from the bladedancer's honored deity. Once the temple is completed, fanatically loyal bladedancers called the "faithful," who need never check morale, will come to defend the Blade-Mistress. There will be 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 bladedancers of 1st-3rd level to serve the order. While in the bladedancer's service, her followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. Additional rules for temples are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Explorer

| Prime Requisite: | STR and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Explorers are scouts and trackers, adept at both woodcraft and archery. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. An explorer might be a long range scout, a barbarian hunter from the northern forests, or a settler pushing past the borders civilization.

While they prefer to evade foes where possible, explorers are cunning warriors when they need to be. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. At first level, explorers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. In addition, they gain an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Explorers are trained to fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wear chain mail or lighter armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Explorers have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Outdoors, explorers are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, an explorer who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.

Parties guided by explorers gain significant advantages on wilderness adventures. Any time the explorer's party is in country familiar to the explorer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the explorer's party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters.

A party guided by an explorer can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+. See the [Wilderness Adventures](Chapter06.md#wilderness-adventures) and [Evasion and Pursuit](Chapter06.md#evasion-and-pursuit) sections of Chapter 6 for more details on getting lost and evading encounters.

When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassures those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer's Charisma or proficiencies.

When an explorer reaches 9th level (Warden), he may decide to build a border fort in the borderlands or wilderness. When he does so, up to 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 explorers of 1st - 3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. The character becomes the warden of any nearby settlers, and will attract more settlers over time. These people will look to the Warden as their leader, responsible for the growth and safety of their settlement. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

## Demi-Human Classes


### Dwarven Vaultguard

| Prime Requisite: | STR
| :--------------- | :----
| Requirements:    | CON 9
| Hit Dice:        | 1d8
| Maximum Level:   | 13

Dwarves are stout, short, bearded demi-humans who average a height of approximately 4' and weigh about 150lb. Perhaps not surprisingly, they have skin, hair and eye colors in earth tones. Dwarves have a reputation for having surly attitudes, and are particularly gruff with elves. They value precious metals and stones, and live in deep underground vaults, where they endure constant raids from the orcs, trolls, and even worse denizens of the darkness below.

Dwarves trained to defend their race's underground vault from the endless hordes that threaten it are called vaultguards. Though most vaultguards are born, live and die in the vault, from time to time a young vaultguard will be dispatched to foreign realms on a warrior's pilgrimage. The few vaultguards who return from such pilgrimages bring gold and glory to their clans, often leading them to found new vaults and become great lords. The dwarven vaultguard class represents such a dwarf.

Dwarven vaultguards are highly trained combatants. At first level, dwarven vaultguards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Due to their short height, dwarven vaultguards cannot use human-sized two-handed weapons (such as two-handed swords or pole arms) or longbows, but they can use any other weapon or armor. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function.

In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the [Dwarven Vaultguard Attack and Saving Throws](Chapter02.md#dwarven-vaultguard-fighter-attack-and-saving-throws) table below. Dwarf characters will speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, dwarves can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

When a dwarven vaultguard reaches 9th level (Vaultlord), he can attract dwarves from far and wide by constructing his own underground vault. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character's clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A dwarven vaultguard is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Dwarven Craftpriest

| Prime Requisite: | WIS
| :--------------- | :----
| Requirements:    | CON 9
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 10

Nothing is so revered among the dwarven people as craftsmanship. A dwarf's work is his life, and the spirits of great dwarven artisans are believed to live on forever in their masterpieces. The veneration of these relics falls to the care of a caste of dwarves known as craftpriests. While most craftpriests attend to the shrines and monuments of their clan, young craftpriests are sometimes sent forth to recover monuments to the glorious past from the ancient ruins and wastelands of the world. This class represents such a craftpriest.

At first level, dwarven craftpriests hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Dwarven craftpriests advance in attack throws and saving throws as clerics, by two points every four levels of experience. Dwarven craftpriests may wear any armor and may use any of the traditional weapons of their people, including the battle axe, great axe, hand axe, flail, mace, morning star, and warhammer. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield or wielding a weapon two-handed, but may not dual wield weapons.

A dwarven craftpriest may turn undead like a cleric. Starting at 2nd level (Craft-Acolyte), a craftpriest may cast divine spells. Craftpriests follow the same spell progression as clerics, use the same rules for learning and casting spells, and select their spells from the same spell list. See the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for details. Because of their religious training, a craftpriest can automatically identify religious symbols, trappings, and holy days of the dwarven faith, and recognizes those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20.

In addition, each dwarven craftpriest is a journeyman in a particular type of craft, such as armor-making, leatherworking, weapon-smithing, etc. With access to craftsman's tools, the character can produce 20gp worth of items per month, and supervise 3 apprentices in his craft. When examining works of his craft, the craftpriest can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. Their attention to detail gives craftpriests a +3 bonus on proficiency rolls for other proficiencies they learn as well.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function. In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the [Dwarven Craftpriest Attack and Saving Throws](Chapter02.md#dwarven-craftpriest-cleric-attack-and-saving-throws) table below. Dwarven characters speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

Starting at 5th level (Craft-Vicar), a craftpriest may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Craft-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs, and craft magical constructs such as golems. At 9th level, he also can construct a vault that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves of the character's clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A Craft-Lord is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Elven Spellsword

| Prime Requisite: | STR and INT
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 10

Elves are lithe, fey beings with pointed ears, delicate features, and graceful movement. They typically weigh about 130lb and stand between 5  1/2 ' and 6' tall. Humans envy their long lifespans and seeming agelessness. Though elves are a peaceful people that enjoy poetry and art, they are also very talented fighters and skilled mages. The elven spellsword class represents one such remarkable elf, trained in the arts of both fighters and mages.

Elven spellswords learn an elegant, deadly style of fighting. At first level, elven spellswords hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. Elven spellswords can wield any weapon and wear any armor. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

In addition to their fighting prowess, elven spellswords cast spells like a mage, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Elven spellswords follow the same spell progression as mages up to 10th level. Unlike (human) mages, elven spellswords can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magic item available to fighters or mages.

Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells are reduced by 1. Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

Starting at 5th level (Thaumaturge-Exemplar), elven spellswords may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. When an elven spellsword reaches 9th level (Wizard-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. These activities are explained in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 9th level (Wizard-Lord), elven spellswords can also establish a fastness in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen. Rather than impose upon nature, this keep must blend seamlessly with it. A total of 3d6x10 1st level elven NPCs will move in to help with it and defend the fastness at no cost to the character. Additional rules for elven fastnesses are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Elven Nightblade

| Prime Requisite: | DEX and INT
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 11

Elves are a subtle race, and never does their gift for finesse and subtlety so reveal itself as in the practice of death-dealing. Cunning, deadly, and rarely seen, the elven nightblade is an assassin and sorcerer whose art is murder. Most nightblades practice their work in the courts of elven nobility.

At first level, elven nightblades hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Elven nightblades advance in attack throws and saving throws as thieves, by two points every four levels of experience. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms.

Elven nightblades may move silently, hide in shadows, climb walls, and backstab as a thief of the same level. In addition, they may perform feats of acrobatics. In lieu of moving during a round, the nightblade may attempt a proficiency throw of 20+ to tumble behind an opponent in melee. The proficiency throw required for the tumble is reduced by 1 per level of experience the character possesses. If successful, the nightblade is now behind his opponent. The opponent loses the benefit of his shield, if any, and the nightblade can backstab his opponent (gaining +4 to his attack throw and bonus damage based on his level). Nightblades also gain a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the situation, such as tilting floors and pit traps.

Elven nightblades cast spells as mages of one-half their level, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Unlike (human) mages, elven nightblades can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magical items available to mages or thieves.

Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Spells, Paralysis, and Petrification are reduced by 1. Elves can speak Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

When they reach 9th level (Nightblade), elven nightblades may construct a hideout. When a nightblade builds a hideout, he will gain 2d6 1st level nightblades as apprentices, come to learn under a master. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These nightblades will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the elven nightblade's local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

When they reach 10th level, elven nightblades may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions, as if they were 5th level mages.

## Alignment

In the Adventurer Conqueror King System, your character will enter a world of ceaseless violent struggle, where civilization is ever-assailed by forces intent on its destruction. In this perilous realm, he will be called to choose a side: Will he pledge to defend civilization and its allies against those who seek to destroy it? Will he sell his sword to any who can offer fame or fortune? Or will he become an agent of entropy and destruction undermining peace and order? This choice is called Alignment, and the three choices are Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.

**Law**: Lawful beings believe that civilization is worth fighting for. Despite its vices and villainies, civilization must be defended against those who would destroy it. Lawful beings tend to see wars among civilizations as aiding the cause of Chaos, and so they seek peace among Lawful civilizations where possible. However, Lawful characters are not pacifists, nor are they necessarily altruists. Indeed, most would think something was wrong with a hero who turned down fame and fortune; chests of gold, magnificent weapons, comely consorts, and grants of land are, after all, the rightful rewards for great deeds of valor on behalf of Law.

**Neutrality**: Neutral beings generally enjoy the benefits of law and civilization, but it is not something they directly fight for. They tend to focus on their own ends, whether those are family, fame, fortune, pleasure, or power. A Neutral mercenary might be found fighting on behalf of Law or Chaos; a neutral farmer tends his crops and pays his taxes, whether to the Patriarch or the Lich-King.

**Chaos**: Chaotic beings actively seek to destroy civil society. Chaotic characters are often madmen or cultists of forgotten, chthonic gods. To the extent they have any order at all, societies of Chaotic characters are ruled by force and fear, and are often characterized by all manner of corruption and vice. Even decadent Lawful civilizations at least pay homage to civilizing virtue, but chaotic civilizations embrace their corruption.

Note that a character's choice of Alignment doesn't determine whether or not he takes care of his children, cheats on his wife, or steals from the merchant's guild. It is concerned only with the weighty issue of where his allegiance lies in the grand struggles of existence. To have an alignment of Lawful or Chaotic is to have chosen a side in this perpetual struggle. Many people, choosing no side, are Neutral, although it is important to remember that most Neutrals still want the protection of Law even though they are not willing to die for it. (To paraphrase George Orwell, Neutral humans sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because Lawful heroes stand ready to do violence on their behalf.)

Human vices, such as greed, lust, and vanity, are widespread and common even in Lawful societies. But Chaotic societies are characterized by their monstrous vices: Genocide, human sacrifice, wanton destruction, cannibalism, necrophilia, and so on. Evil is all-too-human in every civilization, but Chaotic is something both less and more than human.

## Adventuring Parties

The worlds of Adventurer Conqueror King are dangerous and hostile. For the sake of survival, characters team up to undertake adventures because any number or type of monsters could lie in wait. Such groups, known as adventuring parties, are generally composed of a diverse array of classes, so that different characters are able to contribute their specific talents for any given situation. A thief can check for traps, for instance, and fighters are good for muscle. Clerics have spells for healing and divination, while mages are capable of powerful offensive and defensive magic.

Occasionally, there are not enough party members to take on the challenges of an adventure. The party may hire NPCs, such as henchmen or mercenaries, for extra hands. The rules for hiring henchmen and mercenaries are discussed in [Chapter 3, Equipment](Chapter03.md#chapter-3-equipment).

When there are only a small number of players, the Judge may allow them to each play more than one character. Nevertheless, in these cases characters belonging to the same player cannot offer each other special treatment, such as trading or giving away riches or magical items, unless the Judge rules it acceptable.
