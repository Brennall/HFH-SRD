# Chapter 2: Heroes

<i>Hers was a hero, destin'd to command <br>
A martial race, and rule the Latian land, <br>
Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw, <br>
And on the conquer'd world impose the law.</i><br>
– The Aeneid, Book IV (Virgil)


## Ability Scores

By default, the Adventurer Conqueror King System assumes that adventurers are no more or less gifted than the average person. If they become great, it is because of their achievements in play, not because of special advantages during character generation. As a result, the ability scores for ACKS adventurers are generated by rolling 3d6 in order. If the optional Generating Multiple Characters rule is in effect, where players roll up five characters and select the best to play with, then adventurers are perhaps among the top 20% most talented people, but still drawn from the common stock. In some heroic campaign settings, however, the adventurers are men and women of extraordinary gifts – protagonists such as Achilles, Aeneas, Aragorn, Beowulf, Conan, Elric, and Red Sonja are gifted with might, confidence, and power far beyond the norm. 

To account for this, the Heroic Fantasy Handbook offers the following optional methods for rolling up characters with better ability scores.

- Heroic: Roll 4d6 for each ability score in order. Drop the lowest die, tally the remaining dice, and record that result. 
- Legendary: Roll 5d6 for each ability score in order. Drop the lowest 2 dice, tally the remaining dice, and record that result. 

Heroic characters will have ability scores in approximately the same range as the top fifth of normal characters (11-14, averaging 12.24). Legendary characters will have ability scores in approximately the same range as the top fifth of heroic characters (12-16, averaging 13.43). If desired the Judge can have players roll up five characters when using either method. 

EXAMPLE: Newton is creating an adventurer for use in a heroic campaign. The Judge has decided to use the optional “Legendary Ability Scores” and “Generating Multiple Characters” rules. Newton therefore will generate five characters; for each character, he will generate six ability scores, rolling 5d6 for each in order and dropping the lowest 2 dice. This combination of optional rules creates very powerful characters! Newton’s results are, in order for STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, and CHA: #1 STR 13, INT 17, WIS 11, DEX 15, CON 13, CHA 13;  #2 STR 13, INT 11, WIS 15, DEX 16, CON 11, CHA 15; #3 STR 6, INT 14, WIS 16, DEX 12, CON 12, CHA 13; #4  STR 14, INT 9, WIS 16, DEX 14, CON 17, CHA 14; #5 STR 15, INT 15, WIS 16, DEX 13, CON 14, CHA 17. He decides to select character #5. He selects Elven Spellsinger as his character class, reducing STR to 13 to increase CHA to 18. His final character has STR 13, INT 15, WIS 16, DEX 13, CON 14, CHA 18.

###Wisom Modifier

In heroic fantasy campaigns, a character’s WIS modifier should be applied to all saving throws, not just saving throws versus magic.


##Hit Points

Hit points are a measure of a character’s ability to survive in combat. Hit points are not a direct representation of the character’s capacity to receive physical injury. A character with 40 hp cannot survive eight sword stabs to the stomach! Rather, they represent a holistic combination of fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods, all of which contribute to helping the character roll with blows and survive attacks that would have killed a lesser combatant. Therefore, the amount of damage a weapon deals must be understood relative to the hit points of the character struck. It is the percentage of hit points lost, not the raw number lost, that indicates how physically wounded a character or monster is. 

However, in virtually every retro-clone (including ACKS), the elegant abstraction of hit points is marred by an asymmetry between damage and healing. Consider two characters, a normal man with 5 hp and an epic hero with 40 hp. When the normal man is dealt 4 points of damage by a sword, this is a grievous blow (80% of his hit points); when the epic hero is dealt the same 4 points of damage, this is merely a flesh wound (10% of his hp). This is exactly as it should be. Yet when the epic hero is treated with cure light wounds, he recovers 1d6+1 points of damage – enough to repair a light wound, as the spell suggests; while when the normal man is treated with cure light wounds, he is likely to recover from what we just said was a grievous blow that brought him near death. To fix this asymmetry, The Heroic Fantasy Handbook offers rules for proportional healing. 

###Healing

All beings recover hit points through rest. For each full day of complete rest in reasonably sanitary conditions, a creature will recover its base healing rate (BHR). If its rest is interrupted, the creature will not heal that day. A creature’s base healing rate is based on its maximum hit points, as shown on the Base Healing Rate table. A character’s BHR should be recorded on its character sheet, and updated each time the character gains additional hit points. 

EXAMPLE: Athelstan has 12 hp. His base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day. With a full day of complete rest in sanitary conditions, Athelstan will recover between 1 and 4 hp. If his rest is interrupted, he will not heal.

| Max HP        | BHR (hp/day)
| :------------ | ------------:
| 1-3           |            -3
| 4-9           |            -2
| 10-16         |            -1
| 17-23         |             0
| 24-29         |            +1
|30-36          |       	1d10
|37-49	        |           2d6
|50-63	        |           2d8
|64-76	        |           2d10
|77-89	        |           2d12
|90-110	        |           3d10
|111-140	    |           4d10
|141-170	    |           5d10
|171+	        |           6d10, plus 1d10 per 30hp past 170

Characters with the Healing proficiency can shorten their patient’s recovery time. A patient under treatment of Healing recovers twice his base healing rate in hp each day of rest.

EXAMPLE: If Athelstan were the patient of a character with Healing proficiency, he would recover twice his base healing rate of 1d4 hp per day of rest, i.e. 2d4 hp per day of rest.  

Healing also occurs through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous and will typically be equal to one or more days of rest, as shown on the Magical Healing table. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined. 

EXAMPLE: Athelstan (with 12 hp and a base healing rate of 1d4 hp) has sustained 9 points of damage, leaving him with 3 hp. A cleric treats him with comfrey. Comfrey heals its target by half as much as if he had rested for one day, rounded up. Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp per day, so he will heal 1d4/2 hp. The result of the roll is a 3, so Athelstan is healed (3 / 2) 1.5 hp, rounded up to 2 hp. The cleric then casts cure moderate wounds on Athelstan. Cure moderate wounds heals its target as if he had rested for two days, so Athelstan will heal 2d4 hp. The result of the roll is a 5, so Athelstan is healed 5 points. He now has 10 hp of his maximum of 12. 

|Spell/Magic Item	|   Effect*
|:------------|------------:
|Salving Rest   |	The target’s base healing rate is doubled for non-magical healing.
|Cure Light Wounds  |	The target is healed as if he had rested for one day.
|Cure Moderate Wounds   |	The target is healed as if he had rested for two days.
|Cure Major Wounds  |	The target is healed as if he had rested for three days.
|Cure Serious Wounds    |	The target is healed as if he had rested for four days.
|Cure Critical Wounds   |	The target is healed as if he had rested for five days.
|Spirit of Healing  |	Each round, the target is healed as if he had rested for one day.
|Lay on Hands   |	The target is healed as if he had rested for one day per two levels of the healer (rounded up).
|Comfrey    |	The target is healed by half as much as if he had rested for one day (rounded up). 
|Potion of Healing  |	The target is healed as if he had rested for one day.
|Potion of Extra-Healing    |	The target is healed as if he had rested for three days.

*These effects occur instead of the spell or magic item’s effect under the ACKS core rules.

<b>Heroic Breakfast Memorial Rule (Optional):</b> Once per day a character can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest. Halfling characters may consume a second breakfast for an additional recovery of hp. 

###Mortal Wounds

When a creature’s hit points drop to 0 or fewer, the creature is unconscious and possibly dead. The creature’s condition will not be determined until an ally treats its wounds. When this occurs, the unconscious creature must roll 1d20+1d6 on the Mortal Wounds table and apply any appropriate modifiers listed. The modified 1d20 roll determines the unconscious creature’s condition while the modified 1d6 roll determines whether any permanent wounds are suffered. Characters not treated within 24 hours of being unconscious must roll, with no bonus for treatment and at the full -10 penalty for being treated 1 day later. 

<b>Heroic Survival:</b> In heroic fantasy campaigns, heroes are considerably more likely to survive mortal wounds than ordinary men. Adventurers with d6 HD add +2 to their 1d20 roll on the Mortal Wounds table. Adventurers with d8 HD add +4, adventurers with d10 HD add +6, and adventurers with d12 HD add +8.

Some results on the Mortal Wounds table will indicate that a character needs a period of bed rest to recover. During this time, the character cannot recover to more than 1 hp and cannot take any action other than speaking and moving at half speed. The period of bed rest can be shortened with magical healing – simply count the days of rest from the magical healing towards the recovery period. However, a character cannot benefit from more than one type of magical healing per day when recovering from mortal wounds.  

EXAMPLE: A fight goes badly, and Athelstan suffers grievous wounds; he will require 14 days of bed rest to recover. The party hires the patriarch of the local temple to cast cure critical wounds on Athelstan. This heals Athelstan as if he had rested for 5 days. Athelstan now requires (14-5) 9 days of bed rest to recover. 

If a character suffers permanent wounds, powerful healing magic such as a restore life and limb spell, regeneration spell, or ring of regeneration can eliminate any penalties caused. If applied swiftly, other types of healing can also eliminate the penalties from permanent wounds. If healing (magic or proficiency) restores the character to 1 hit point within 1 turn (10 minutes) of receiving the permanent wound, then the penalties from the permanent wound will be eliminated once the character completes the required bed rest. The permanent wound’s effects will still be present during the recovery period, however.  

EXAMPLE: During a defense of the town from orc raiders, Athelstan is reduced to -9 hp and must roll on the Mortal Wounds table. The roll goes badly – grievous wounds resulting in one of his arms being crushed. Fortunately, the patriarch of the local temple is nearby, and able to cast cure critical wounds on Athelstan just a few rounds after he is injured. Since Athelstan’s base healing rate is 1d4 hp, cure critical wounds heals him of 5d4 hp. The roll is a 10, enough to raise him to 1 hp. When Athelstan finishes his period of bed rest (2 weeks), he will regain use of his arm. 

If a character dies, he can be revived with restore life and limb, reincarnation, or other magical effect that restores the dead to life. Characters treated with restore life and limb often need extensive periods of time to recover, and may suffer strange side effects. The character must roll 1d20+1d6 on the Tampering with Mortality table and apply any appropriate modifiers listed. The resulting side effects are permanent and can only be removed with a wish spell. The recovery period, if any, from tampering with mortality can be shorted with magical healing as described above. Note that magic which can restore the dead to life is very rare in campaigns using the Heroic Fantasy Handbook.

<b>Khal Drogo Memorial Rule (Optional):</b> In worlds where wounds can fester and grow foul there is no assurance that an injured hero will recover. Each day that a character rests while recovering from incapacitation, he must make a saving throw versus Death. Apply the character’s CON modifier to the saving throw. If the save succeeds, the day counts towards his period of bed rest. If the save fails, the character’s condition does not improve. If the save fails by 5 or more, or with a natural 1, the character’s condition worsens and the period of bed rest required advances by one day.  If the remaining period of bed rest required ever reaches more than 45 days, the character dies of sepsis, shock, or system failure. This optional rule does not apply to magical healing, but if you’re using this rule, you’re probably not allowing that anyway!

###Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points represent temporary blessings or inspiration during which character’s fighting skill, stamina, luck, and the favor of the gods is improved. Temporary hit points are not actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage.  Characters with temporary hit points who take damage lose the temporary hit points first, with any leftover damage carrying over to their normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. A character can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points. Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If a character has 0 or fewer hit points, receiving temporary hit points does not count as healing. 

##New and Modified Character Classes

In order to better represent the archetypes that appear in heroic fantasy, the Heroic Fantasy Handbook introduces several new campaign and racial classes. The core, campaign, and racial character classes presented in the Adventurer Conqueror King System and the Player’s Companion can also be used in Heroic Fantasy Handbook campaigns, although we recommend that some classes be modified or replaced, as noted below. To avoid forcing players to flip between multiple books, we have included complete descriptions of class powers such as turn undead even if they have already appeared elsewhere.

###New Character Classes

The new classes in this book include the beastmaster, berserker,  chosen, ecclesiastic, elven spellsinger, freebooter, halfling bounder, halfling burglar, loremaster, Nobiran champion, Nobiran wizard, occultist, runemaker, Thrassian deathchanter, warmistress, Zaharan darklord, and Zaharan sorcerer. In addition, a revised magic-free version of the venturer (originally appearing in the Player’s Companion) is presented.

###Beastmaster

<i>His straight and perfect figure, muscled as the best of the ancient Roman gladiators must have been muscled, and yet with the soft and sinuous curves of a Greek god, told at a glance the wondrous combination of enormous strength with suppleness and speed. A personification, was Tarzan of the Apes, of the primitive man, the hunter, the warrior. With the noble poise of his handsome head upon those broad shoulders, and the fire of life and intelligence in those fine, clear eyes, he might readily have typified some demigod of a wild and warlike bygone people of his ancient forest.</i> – Tarzan of the Apes (E.R. Burroughs)

Some kings and heroes, dreadful in aspect and demeanor, are whispered to have been raised by beasts, suckled by wolves, adopted by the wild. Such tales are rarely true. Most feral children live short and brutish lives, dying young without ever seeing another of their own kind; even if found, they have often regressed into a state of savagery from which their natural humanity cannot free them. But from time to time, a child, abandoned or lost to civilization and adopted by beasts, may be endowed with the strength and character to transcend both man and beast and become something greater. Such children, if they survive, become beastmasters – lords of the wild, combining the ferocity and toughness of a predator with the cunning and courage of a hero.

*Hit point modifiers from constitution are ignored

Beastmasters fight with the instincts and aggression of natural predators. At first level, beastmasters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their damage from attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.  Beastmasters care nothing for civilized concepts such as chivalric combat, preferring to attack with surprise whenever possible. They may backstab as thieves of their class level. 

However, beastmasters lack formal training in arms and armor, and can wield only primitive weapons of the sort they could have fashioned in the wild: spears, hand axes, daggers, bolas, darts, nets, slings, saps, and staves. They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each had, but may not use shields nor wear armor.  They may use only magic items usable by fighters.

Due to their savage upbringing, beastmasters have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. They are constantly alert to danger, and can hear noises as a thief of their class level. From the unspeakable hardships they have endured, beastmasters gain savage resilience. When a beastmaster is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply.  Beastmasters also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover. 

At a young age, beastmasters learn to clamber up trees, cliffs, and other vertical services with the agility of a monkey. As a result, all beastmasters can climb as a thief of their class level. They also can perform feats of acrobatics such as swinging on vines or leaping over foes. In lieu of moving during a round, a beastmaster may attempt a proficiency throw of 20+ to tumble behind an opponent in melee. The proficiency throw required for the tumble is reduced by 1 per level of experience the character possesses. If successful, the beastmaster is now behind his opponent. The opponent loses the benefit of his shield, if any, and the beastmaster can backstab his opponent (gaining +4 to his attack throw and bonus damage based on his level). Beastmasters also gain a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the situation, such as tilting floors and pit traps.

Like other predators of the night, beastmasters are naturally stealthy, and opponents suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering them. Outdoors, beastmasters are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, a beastmaster who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. 

As natives of the wild, beastmasters bring significant advantages to parties on wilderness adventures. Any time the beastmaster’s party is in country familiar to the beastmaster, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the beastmaster’s party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. A party guided by a beastmaster can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+.  

Once per day, a beastmaster may shout a bestial cry that can be heard up to 750’ away.  Hostile ordinary animals hearing the cry must immediately make a successful morale roll or run away from the beastmaster. Other ordinary animals hearing the beastmaster’s cry may come to his assistance. If the animal is friendly to the beastmaster (e.g. if it is a henchman, a trained animal, or resident within 5 miles of his encampment) it will automatically run or fly to his assistance as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the Judge should make a reaction roll for each animal, with a Friendly result indicating the creature comes to the beastmaster’s assistance. 

Having been raised by and with animals, all beastmasters are friends of birds and beasts. They understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character), which grants beastmasters a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals and allows them to take animals as henchmen. They also can identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+.

Conversely, all beastmasters are discomfited by civilization. The sights, smells, and ways of cities are foreign and offensive to them. A beastmaster suffers a penalty to reaction rolls when in urban settlements equal to 7 minus the settlement’s market value. 

When purchasing starting equipment, a beastmaster may only select primitive weapons, animal parts (from Lairs & Encounters) blankets, healing herbs, ropes, poles, rations, sacks, stakes, tents, torches, and trained animals. However, any trained animals that the beastmaster begins play with may be immediately recruited as henchmen if desired. Any unspent coin is lost.

When a beastmaster reaches 5th level (Mighty Warrior), his animal magnetism begins to inspire the men and beasts that follow him. Any henchmen of the beastmaster, and any guard or hunting animals handled by the beastmaster, gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the beastmaster’s Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Lord of the Wild), a beastmaster can establish an encampment in a wilderness hex. A beastmaster’s encampment is often centered on a wooden cabin or house perched in the highest branches of a great tree. A beastmaster does not attract followers when he establishes an encampment, but he does gain the fellowship of animals: all ordinary animals within 5 miles of it become kind and helpful (as per an elven fastness).

## Core Classes


### Fighter

| Prime Requisite: | STR
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d8
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Fighters are exclusively trained in the arts of combat and war. They are specialists at dealing physical blows. Fighters may have learned their arts as warriors, gladiators battling for glory in the arena, raiders, or sell-swords in the games of the noble houses.

As their name suggests, fighters are exceptionally skilled combatants. Fighters are trained in the use of all weapons and armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, or wielding a weapon in each hand, as desired. At first level, fighters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (the best progression of any class). Fighters also increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

When a fighter reaches 5th level (Exemplar), his battlefield prowess inspires others to follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the fighter gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the fighter's Charisma or proficiencies.

At 9th level (Warlord), a fighter can, assuming enough gold is at hand, build a castle and become a great leader of men, taking a leadership rank in his society. When he does so, up 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 fighters of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Through force of arms, the fighter may ultimately control several castles or even entire realms, but must be a capable, strong leader and provide protection. Additional rules for castles are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Mage

| Prime Requisite: | INT
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Sometimes called wizards, sorcerers, or magicians, mages study arcane secrets and cast spells. While early in their career mages have only limited power, experienced mages are able to cast a great number of powerful spells. A mage may be a wizard steeped in ancient lore, a sinister sorcerer, or a village witch or hedge wizard with strange charms and hodge-podge traditions.

Because of their devotion to arcane study, mages receive limited combat training. At first level, mages hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., half as fast as fighters). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, and darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. For these reasons, mages are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.

In exchange for these weaknesses, mages can learn and cast many powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the mage can use in a single day are listed on the [Mage Spell Progression](Chapter02.md#mage-level-and-spell-progression) table. A mage's spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A mage's repertoire can include a number of spells up to to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. For instance, Quintus, a 3rd level mage, is able to cast 2 1st level spells and 1 2nd level spell per day. If he has 16 INT (+2 modifier) he can have up to 4 1st level and 3 2nd level spells in his repertoire. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter.

When a mage reaches 5th level (Thaumaturge), he may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. When a mage reaches 9th level (Wizard), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A mage may also build a sanctum, often a great tower, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal men seeking to become mages. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the mage's service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the mage builds a dungeon beneath or near his tower, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them. Additional rules for mages' sanctum are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 11th level, a mage may learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the mage may create necromantic servants and become undead. These rules are in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Cleric

| Prime Requisite: | WIS
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Clerics are holy crusaders, trained to fight to further the ends of their faith. Humans who become clerics have pledged their lives to serve a particular deity or religion. To this end, they conduct their lives in a way that furthers the desires and will of their gods or goddesses. A cleric may be a priest-militant, a cultist sworn to the chthonic powers of the Nether Darkness, or anything in between.

Clerics are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. At first level, clerics hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (a progression mid-way between fighters and mages). As holy warriors, clerics are trained to wear any armor and fight with a variety of weapons. The particular weapons that clerics are trained to fight with are determined by the strictures of their religious order.

If your Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default cleric is assumed to be a worshipper of the God of Law and Light. Strict holy doctrine prevents these clerics from using any weapons that shed blood. The cleric of Law and Light may use only blunt weapons such as warhammers, maces, clubs, quarterstaffs, and slings. This cleric may use any shields or fight with two-handed weapons, but is not trained to fight with weapons in each hand (i.e. he may not 'dual wield'). (See the [bladedancer campaign class](Chapter02.md#bladedancer) for an example of a cleric variant with a different feel).

All clerics have the ability to turn undead, calling upon the name and power of their deity to turn away, and even destroy, undead. The potency of this ability is determined by level. On the [Turning Undead](Chapter02.md#cleric-turning-undead-by-cleric-level) table, there will be a dash, a "T", a "D", or a number corresponding to the type of undead monster and the level of the cleric. A dash means that the cleric has not attained high enough level to turn the undead type. A "T" means that the cleric automatically turns the undead, and a "D" means that the undead will be destroyed automatically. A number indicates that the player must roll that number or higher on 1d20 in order to turn the undead. If this roll is successful, or there is a "T" in the chart, the player rolls 2d6 and the result equals the number of total Hit Dice of undead monsters turned. A "D" in the chart requires the same roll to determine how many HD of undead are destroyed. No matter what the dice roll result, at least one undead monster will always be turned or destroyed, as appropriate, on a successful use of turning.

There is no limit to how often a cleric may attempt to turn undead each day, but if an attempt to turn undead fails during an encounter, the cleric may not attempt to turn undead again for the remainder of that encounter.

*Example*: Balbus the Blessed, a 1st level cleric, attempts to turn 4 foul undead skeletons. When Balbus's player looks at the [Turning Undead](Chapter02.md#cleric-turning-undead-by-cleric-level) table, the value corresponding to his level and the entry for skeletons is 10+. He will turn some undead on a roll of 10 or higher on 1d20. He rolls a result of 12, meaning some skeletons will be turned. To determine how many HD he turns, he rolls 2d6 and comes up with a 3. Since skeletons have 1 HD each, three of them flee, leaving one behind for Balbus to vanquish.

If Balbus had been attempting to turn zombies, or other undead that have 2 HD each, he would only have turned one, since a roll of three only completely accounts for one 2 HD monster.

Turned undead flee the area for 10 rounds by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. If the cleric attacks turned undead in melee combat, the turning effect is broken, but he can use spells or missile weapons against them, and other characters may attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect. Destroyed undead are immediately turned to ash.

Certain chaotic sects teach their clerics to control undead rather than turn them. The undead are controlled for 1 turn per level of the cleric. If the undead would have been destroyed, the undead are controlled for 1 day per level of the cleric instead. Controlled undead behave as if charmed, obeying the cleric as if they were friends. However, if the controlled undead are turned or destroyed by a cleric during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee (as if turned).

Starting at 2nd level (Acolyte), clerics may manifest their deity's power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The power and number of divine spells available to the character are determined by level according to the [Cleric Spell Progression](Chapter02.md#cleric-level-and-spell-progression) table. See the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for a list of all available spells.

In order to use spells and turn undead, clerics must uphold the doctrines of their faith and god. If a cleric ever falls from favor, due to violating the beliefs of his god or breaking the rules of his clergy, the god may impose penalties upon the cleric. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge, but might include penalties to attack or a reduction in spells available. More information on casting spells and individual spell descriptions can be found in the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter.

When a cleric reaches 5th level (Vicar), he may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Patriarch), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a cleric may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the cleric will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead himself. These activities are explained in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

Upon attaining 9th level (Patriarch), a cleric may establish or build a fortified church. So long as the cleric is currently in favor with his god, he may buy or build his fortified church at half the normal price due to divine intervention. Once a fortified church is established, the cleric's reputation will spread and he will attract 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 clerics of 1st-3rd level of the same religion to serve the order. They are completely loyal (morale +4). While in the cleric's service, his followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. The Judge determines which proportions of followers are archers, infantry, etc. Additional rules for fortified churches are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Thief

| Prime Requisite: | DEX
| :--------------- | :---
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d4
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Thieves have a range of unique skills associated with their profession that make them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves can be a bit shady and they sometimes are not as trustworthy as other classes. A thief will usually belong to a Thieves' Guild from the character's local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. At the Judge's discretion, a thief may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. Thieves are everywhere, from the slums to the highest halls of the government.

Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first level, thieves hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. Because of their need for stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands.

A thief also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the thief will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained. A thief at 1st through 4th levels does double the normal damage, at 5th-8th levels does triple the normal damage, at 9th-12th levels does quadruple the normal damage, and at 13th level or higher does quintuple the normal damage.

Thieves have the following range of skills, which improve as the thief gains levels according to the progression on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table. When a thief attempts to make use of one of his skills, the character or Judge will make a proficiency throw of 1d20. (Usually the Judge will make rolls for these abilities, because a thief is not always aware when he has failed.) After applying any relevant modifiers (e.g. due to the complexity of a lock), the result is compared to the target value listed on the [Thief Skills](Chapter02.md#thief-skills) table below for the appropriate skill. A result that is greater than or equal to the value listed for the proficiency throw that corresponds to the thief's level is a success. A roll of 20 is always a success, and a roll of 1 is always a failure.

**Opening Locks**: With the aid of thieves' tools, a thief may pick mechanical locks. He may only try to pick a particular lock once, and if he fails, he may not try the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the lock.

**Finding and Removing Traps**: Through careful inspection and probing, a thief may find hidden traps and then attempt to disable or discharge the trap harmlessly. A thief may only try to find or remove a trap once in any given area. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the trap. If the thief fails, he may not try again until he reaches a higher experience level. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he can remove it.

**Picking Pockets**: This skill is the bread and butter of non-adventuring thieves for it is a quick source of income - though not without peril. A throw that is less than half the target value means that the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim's reaction.

**Moving Silently**: Thieves may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Thieves may move silently at  1/2  their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than  1/2  speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.

**Climbing Walls**: Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Thieves climb at  1/4  their standard combat movement rate.

**Hiding in Shadows**: A thief may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A thief will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.

**Hearing Noises**: Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway and at a door or other locations. The thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment.

Upon attaining 4th level, a thief gains the ability to read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a thief attains 9th level (Master Thief), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. A successful character might use these followers to start a Thieves' Guild. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, a thief can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

### Assassin

| Prime Requisite: | STR and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Assassins are humans who train to kill by ambush and treachery. Assassins may be back-alley brawlers, violent thugs, or members of an organized guild. Some assassins are members of an order of Assassins, a religious brotherhood of trained killers, or are simply murders-for-hire or rogues with a taste for violence.

Assassins are expert combatants, though lacking somewhat in toughness (hit points). At first level, assassins hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. Assassins increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.

Assassins may use any weapon without limitation. Although assassins generally prefer fast, concealable, or quiet weapons, killing can occur under many circumstances. They may fight using a weapon two-handed, a weapon in each hand, or a weapon and shield.

Assassins may wear any type of armor, but most favor stealth over steel. When wearing leather armor or lighter garb, an assassin may move silently, hide in shadows, and backstab as a thief of the same level. If wear armor heavier than leather, these abilities are not available.

Upon reaching 9th level (Assassin), an assassin may construct a hideout. When an assassin builds a hideout, he will gain 2d6 1st level assassin apprentices, come to learn under a master. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These thugs will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the assassin's local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Bard

| Prime Requisite: | DEX and CHA
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Successful adventurers live forever in the sagas and songs about their deeds. Remembering and recounting these sagas is the profession of bards. Most bards are content to recite the deeds of others, but some bold few participate in the dangers themselves and become inspiring heroes in their own right. A bard might be an adventuring minstrel with a sword in his hand and a song at his lips, a warrior-skald, or haughty aristocrat.

Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws as a thief, by two points every four levels of experience. At first level, bards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wield a weapon in each hand if desired. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields.

All bards can sing, recite poetry, or play a group of instruments in a skilled manner. The bard chooses the type of performance that his character knows. A bard may take the Perform proficiency to learn other types of performances (see [Chapter 4, Proficiencies](Chapter04.md#chapter-4-proficiencies)).

By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires  a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the bard's allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring epic gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.

Because of their study of ancient annals and legends, bards possess loremastery. This knowledge allows them to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a bard must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in these tasks. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level.

This same knowledge allows bards to dabble in the arcane. They may attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic Items only useable by mages. At 1st level, the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge's discretion). The proficiency throw required reduces by 2 per level, to a minimum of 3+.

Upon attaining 4th level (Annalist), the bard gains the ability to read languages, including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings. A proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20 is required. If the roll does not succeed, the bard may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.

When a bard reaches 5th level (Chronicler), his chronicles of battle inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the bard is there to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard's Charisma or proficiencies.

Upon reaching 9th level (Bard), a bard can build a hall and become a ruler. When he does so, up 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 bards of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Additional rules for halls are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 10th level, the bard can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge's discretion.

### Bladedancer

| Prime Requisite: | WIS and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Bladedancers are human women who have dedicated themselves to the service of a goddess of war. They belong to military clerical orders, where they are trained in fighting and casting spells. Most bladedancers are trained to the art from a young age at the Temples of the Goddess of Love and War. A fully trained bladedancer is highly coveted as a bodyguard and escort by the great noble houses.

Bladedancers are skilled combatants. At first level, bladedancers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance like clerics in attack throws and saving throws, by two points every four levels of experience. By religious doctrine, bladedancers are forbidden from debasing themselves with the fighting implements of the peasantry, or dishonorably firing missiles from a distance. A bladedancer may only use piercing and slashing melee weapons, such as daggers, swords, spears, and polearms. This eliminates weapons such as clubs, maces, and warhammers, as well as bows, slings, and crossbows.

A bladedancer may wield a weapon in each hand, or fight with a two-handed weapon, but may not resort to shields. Bladedancers are only trained to fight in leather or lighter armor. However, they gain a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to Armor Class if able to move freely. At level 7, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 the AC bonus increases to +3.

A bladedancer may turn undead like a cleric. Starting at 2nd level, a bladedancer may cast divine spells. Bladedancers follow the same spell progression as clerics and use the same rules for learning and casting spells. However, a bladedancer's spell list is slightly different than a cleric's; see the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for details. Like clerics, bladedancers must uphold the doctrines of their faith and god, and suffer penalties if they violate them.

When a bladedancer reaches 5th level (Blade-Sister), she may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Blade-Mistress), she is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a bladedancer may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the bladedancer will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead herself. These activities are explained in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

When a bladedancer reaches 9th level (Blade-Mistress), she may choose to construct a temple as a stronghold. If she has not lost the favor of her deity, the cost of building the temple will be half the normal amount due to miraculous assistance from the bladedancer's honored deity. Once the temple is completed, fanatically loyal bladedancers called the "faithful," who need never check morale, will come to defend the Blade-Mistress. There will be 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 bladedancers of 1st-3rd level to serve the order. While in the bladedancer's service, her followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. Additional rules for temples are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Explorer

| Prime Requisite: | STR and DEX
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 14

Explorers are scouts and trackers, adept at both woodcraft and archery. Few adventuring parties would dare the wilderness without an experienced explorer to guide them. An explorer might be a long range scout, a barbarian hunter from the northern forests, or a settler pushing past the borders civilization.

While they prefer to evade foes where possible, explorers are cunning warriors when they need to be. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. At first level, explorers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. In addition, they gain an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Explorers are trained to fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wear chain mail or lighter armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Explorers have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Outdoors, explorers are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, an explorer who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.

Parties guided by explorers gain significant advantages on wilderness adventures. Any time the explorer's party is in country familiar to the explorer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the explorer's party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters.

A party guided by an explorer can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+. See the [Wilderness Adventures](Chapter06.md#wilderness-adventures) and [Evasion and Pursuit](Chapter06.md#evasion-and-pursuit) sections of Chapter 6 for more details on getting lost and evading encounters.

When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassures those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer's Charisma or proficiencies.

When an explorer reaches 9th level (Warden), he may decide to build a border fort in the borderlands or wilderness. When he does so, up to 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 explorers of 1st - 3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. The character becomes the warden of any nearby settlers, and will attract more settlers over time. These people will look to the Warden as their leader, responsible for the growth and safety of their settlement. Additional rules for border forts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

## Demi-Human Classes


### Dwarven Vaultguard

| Prime Requisite: | STR
| :--------------- | :----
| Requirements:    | CON 9
| Hit Dice:        | 1d8
| Maximum Level:   | 13

Dwarves are stout, short, bearded demi-humans who average a height of approximately 4' and weigh about 150lb. Perhaps not surprisingly, they have skin, hair and eye colors in earth tones. Dwarves have a reputation for having surly attitudes, and are particularly gruff with elves. They value precious metals and stones, and live in deep underground vaults, where they endure constant raids from the orcs, trolls, and even worse denizens of the darkness below.

Dwarves trained to defend their race's underground vault from the endless hordes that threaten it are called vaultguards. Though most vaultguards are born, live and die in the vault, from time to time a young vaultguard will be dispatched to foreign realms on a warrior's pilgrimage. The few vaultguards who return from such pilgrimages bring gold and glory to their clans, often leading them to found new vaults and become great lords. The dwarven vaultguard class represents such a dwarf.

Dwarven vaultguards are highly trained combatants. At first level, dwarven vaultguards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Due to their short height, dwarven vaultguards cannot use human-sized two-handed weapons (such as two-handed swords or pole arms) or longbows, but they can use any other weapon or armor. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function.

In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the [Dwarven Vaultguard Attack and Saving Throws](Chapter02.md#dwarven-vaultguard-fighter-attack-and-saving-throws) table below. Dwarf characters will speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, dwarves can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

When a dwarven vaultguard reaches 9th level (Vaultlord), he can attract dwarves from far and wide by constructing his own underground vault. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character's clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A dwarven vaultguard is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Dwarven Craftpriest

| Prime Requisite: | WIS
| :--------------- | :----
| Requirements:    | CON 9
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 10

Nothing is so revered among the dwarven people as craftsmanship. A dwarf's work is his life, and the spirits of great dwarven artisans are believed to live on forever in their masterpieces. The veneration of these relics falls to the care of a caste of dwarves known as craftpriests. While most craftpriests attend to the shrines and monuments of their clan, young craftpriests are sometimes sent forth to recover monuments to the glorious past from the ancient ruins and wastelands of the world. This class represents such a craftpriest.

At first level, dwarven craftpriests hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Dwarven craftpriests advance in attack throws and saving throws as clerics, by two points every four levels of experience. Dwarven craftpriests may wear any armor and may use any of the traditional weapons of their people, including the battle axe, great axe, hand axe, flail, mace, morning star, and warhammer. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield or wielding a weapon two-handed, but may not dual wield weapons.

A dwarven craftpriest may turn undead like a cleric. Starting at 2nd level (Craft-Acolyte), a craftpriest may cast divine spells. Craftpriests follow the same spell progression as clerics, use the same rules for learning and casting spells, and select their spells from the same spell list. See the [Spells](Chapter05.md#chapter-5-spells) chapter for details. Because of their religious training, a craftpriest can automatically identify religious symbols, trappings, and holy days of the dwarven faith, and recognizes those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20.

In addition, each dwarven craftpriest is a journeyman in a particular type of craft, such as armor-making, leatherworking, weapon-smithing, etc. With access to craftsman's tools, the character can produce 20gp worth of items per month, and supervise 3 apprentices in his craft. When examining works of his craft, the craftpriest can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. Their attention to detail gives craftpriests a +3 bonus on proficiency rolls for other proficiencies they learn as well.

Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function. In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. These adjustments are already factored into the saving throws on the [Dwarven Craftpriest Attack and Saving Throws](Chapter02.md#dwarven-craftpriest-cleric-attack-and-saving-throws) table below. Dwarven characters speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.

Starting at 5th level (Craft-Vicar), a craftpriest may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Craft-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs, and craft magical constructs such as golems. At 9th level, he also can construct a vault that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves of the character's clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A Craft-Lord is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. Additional rules for dwarven vaults are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Elven Spellsword

| Prime Requisite: | STR and INT
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 10

Elves are lithe, fey beings with pointed ears, delicate features, and graceful movement. They typically weigh about 130lb and stand between 5  1/2 ' and 6' tall. Humans envy their long lifespans and seeming agelessness. Though elves are a peaceful people that enjoy poetry and art, they are also very talented fighters and skilled mages. The elven spellsword class represents one such remarkable elf, trained in the arts of both fighters and mages.

Elven spellswords learn an elegant, deadly style of fighting. At first level, elven spellswords hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. Elven spellswords can wield any weapon and wear any armor. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, and wielding a weapon in each hand.

In addition to their fighting prowess, elven spellswords cast spells like a mage, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Elven spellswords follow the same spell progression as mages up to 10th level. Unlike (human) mages, elven spellswords can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magic item available to fighters or mages.

Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells are reduced by 1. Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

Starting at 5th level (Thaumaturge-Exemplar), elven spellswords may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. When an elven spellsword reaches 9th level (Wizard-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. These activities are explained in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

At 9th level (Wizard-Lord), elven spellswords can also establish a fastness in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen. Rather than impose upon nature, this keep must blend seamlessly with it. A total of 3d6x10 1st level elven NPCs will move in to help with it and defend the fastness at no cost to the character. Additional rules for elven fastnesses are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

### Elven Nightblade

| Prime Requisite: | DEX and INT
| :--------------- | :----------
| Requirements:    | None
| Hit Dice:        | 1d6
| Maximum Level:   | 11

Elves are a subtle race, and never does their gift for finesse and subtlety so reveal itself as in the practice of death-dealing. Cunning, deadly, and rarely seen, the elven nightblade is an assassin and sorcerer whose art is murder. Most nightblades practice their work in the courts of elven nobility.

At first level, elven nightblades hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Elven nightblades advance in attack throws and saving throws as thieves, by two points every four levels of experience. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms.

Elven nightblades may move silently, hide in shadows, climb walls, and backstab as a thief of the same level. In addition, they may perform feats of acrobatics. In lieu of moving during a round, the nightblade may attempt a proficiency throw of 20+ to tumble behind an opponent in melee. The proficiency throw required for the tumble is reduced by 1 per level of experience the character possesses. If successful, the nightblade is now behind his opponent. The opponent loses the benefit of his shield, if any, and the nightblade can backstab his opponent (gaining +4 to his attack throw and bonus damage based on his level). Nightblades also gain a +2 bonus to saving throws where agility would help avoid the situation, such as tilting floors and pit traps.

Elven nightblades cast spells as mages of one-half their level, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Unlike (human) mages, elven nightblades can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magical items available to mages or thieves.

Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Spells, Paralysis, and Petrification are reduced by 1. Elves can speak Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.

When they reach 9th level (Nightblade), elven nightblades may construct a hideout. When a nightblade builds a hideout, he will gain 2d6 1st level nightblades as apprentices, come to learn under a master. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These nightblades will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the elven nightblade's local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character. Additional rules for hideouts are detailed in the [Campaigns](Chapter07.md#chapter-7-campaigns) chapter.

When they reach 10th level, elven nightblades may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions, as if they were 5th level mages.

## Alignment

In the Adventurer Conqueror King System, your character will enter a world of ceaseless violent struggle, where civilization is ever-assailed by forces intent on its destruction. In this perilous realm, he will be called to choose a side: Will he pledge to defend civilization and its allies against those who seek to destroy it? Will he sell his sword to any who can offer fame or fortune? Or will he become an agent of entropy and destruction undermining peace and order? This choice is called Alignment, and the three choices are Lawful, Neutral, and Chaotic.

**Law**: Lawful beings believe that civilization is worth fighting for. Despite its vices and villainies, civilization must be defended against those who would destroy it. Lawful beings tend to see wars among civilizations as aiding the cause of Chaos, and so they seek peace among Lawful civilizations where possible. However, Lawful characters are not pacifists, nor are they necessarily altruists. Indeed, most would think something was wrong with a hero who turned down fame and fortune; chests of gold, magnificent weapons, comely consorts, and grants of land are, after all, the rightful rewards for great deeds of valor on behalf of Law.

**Neutrality**: Neutral beings generally enjoy the benefits of law and civilization, but it is not something they directly fight for. They tend to focus on their own ends, whether those are family, fame, fortune, pleasure, or power. A Neutral mercenary might be found fighting on behalf of Law or Chaos; a neutral farmer tends his crops and pays his taxes, whether to the Patriarch or the Lich-King.

**Chaos**: Chaotic beings actively seek to destroy civil society. Chaotic characters are often madmen or cultists of forgotten, chthonic gods. To the extent they have any order at all, societies of Chaotic characters are ruled by force and fear, and are often characterized by all manner of corruption and vice. Even decadent Lawful civilizations at least pay homage to civilizing virtue, but chaotic civilizations embrace their corruption.

Note that a character's choice of Alignment doesn't determine whether or not he takes care of his children, cheats on his wife, or steals from the merchant's guild. It is concerned only with the weighty issue of where his allegiance lies in the grand struggles of existence. To have an alignment of Lawful or Chaotic is to have chosen a side in this perpetual struggle. Many people, choosing no side, are Neutral, although it is important to remember that most Neutrals still want the protection of Law even though they are not willing to die for it. (To paraphrase George Orwell, Neutral humans sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because Lawful heroes stand ready to do violence on their behalf.)

Human vices, such as greed, lust, and vanity, are widespread and common even in Lawful societies. But Chaotic societies are characterized by their monstrous vices: Genocide, human sacrifice, wanton destruction, cannibalism, necrophilia, and so on. Evil is all-too-human in every civilization, but Chaotic is something both less and more than human.

## Adventuring Parties

The worlds of Adventurer Conqueror King are dangerous and hostile. For the sake of survival, characters team up to undertake adventures because any number or type of monsters could lie in wait. Such groups, known as adventuring parties, are generally composed of a diverse array of classes, so that different characters are able to contribute their specific talents for any given situation. A thief can check for traps, for instance, and fighters are good for muscle. Clerics have spells for healing and divination, while mages are capable of powerful offensive and defensive magic.

Occasionally, there are not enough party members to take on the challenges of an adventure. The party may hire NPCs, such as henchmen or mercenaries, for extra hands. The rules for hiring henchmen and mercenaries are discussed in [Chapter 3, Equipment](Chapter03.md#chapter-3-equipment).

When there are only a small number of players, the Judge may allow them to each play more than one character. Nevertheless, in these cases characters belonging to the same player cannot offer each other special treatment, such as trading or giving away riches or magical items, unless the Judge rules it acceptable.
