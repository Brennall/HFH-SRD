# Chapter 8: Heroic Secrets

## Custom Classes

All of the new classes in this supplement were built using rules in the ACKS Player’s Companion with new or modified class categories. The following rules modify and supplement the Custom Class rules in Chapter 4 of ACKS Player’s Companion.

### Build Points and Class Categories

All Human Classes have 4 (four) build points to spend on five class categories: Hit Dice, Arcane, Ceremonial, Divine, Eldritch, Fighting, and Thievery. Each category is allocated between 0 and 4 points. The Hit Dice class category determines the Hit Die the class uses, while the other class categories grant abilities associated with character classes. The final total spent on the class must equal 4 build points.

### Eldritch Value

|Value|	Eldritch|	XP Cost
| :- | :- | :-
|4|	Wizard + 4 class powers	|2500
|3|	⅔ level Wizard + 3 class powers	|1875
|2|	½ level Wizard + 2 class powers	|1250
|1|	⅓ level Wizard +1 class powers	|625
|0|	none	|0

The Eldritch Value allows characters to be eldritch spellcasters. As explained in the Heroic Magic chapter, eldritch magic has two drawbacks compared to arcane magic – its spells are less powerful and its spellcasters can suffer corruption. To balance these drawbacks, the Eldritch Value offers class powers that the Arcane Value does not.

**Eldritch 1:** An Eldritch Value of 1 gives the class the ability to learn and cast eldritch spells and engage in magical research as a Nobiran wizard of ⅓ the character’s actual class level, rounded down. For instance, at 3rd level, the character has the abilities of a 1st level Nobiran wizard. The class uses its effective caster level (⅓ its level of experience) for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage. In addition, the class receives one class power. In lieu of the class power, the class may take spellsinging.

**Eldritch 2:** An Eldritch Value of 2 gives the class the ability to learn and cast eldritch spells and engage in magical research as a Nobiran wizard of ½ the character’s actual class level. After 1st level, round fractions of 0.5 or greater up. For instance, at 5th level, the character has the abilities of a 3rd level Nobiran wizard. The class uses its effective caster level (½ its level of experience) for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage. In addition, the class receives two class powers. In lieu of these class powers, the class may take spellsinging.

**Eldritch 3:** An Eldritch Value of 3 gives the class the ability to learn and cast eldritch spells and engage in magical research as a Nobiran wizard of ⅔ the character’s actual class level. Round fractions of 0.5 or greater up. For instance, at 5th level, the character has the abilities of a 4th level Nobiran wizard. The class uses its effective caster level (⅔ its level of experience) for purposes of level-dependent spell ranges, durations, and damage. In addition, the class receives three class powers. In lieu of these class powers, the class may take spellsinging.

**Eldritch 4:** An Eldritch Value of 4 gives the class the ability to learn and cast eldritch spells and engage in magical research as a Nobiran wizard. In addition, the class receives four class powers. In lieu of these class powers, the class may take spellsinging.

The selection of class powers received from the Eldritch Value may be exchanged for a larger selection at a higher level of experience if desired.

#### Spellcasting and Magic Research

All eldritch spellcasters use the same spell progression as Nobiran wizards (a spell progression which is roughly 15% better than that of mages). They select their spells from the eldritch spell list and are susceptible to corruption (see Shades of Magic, p. XX). They may collect and use divine power as clerics. Eldritch spellcasters with an effective caster level of 5 or more can research spells, brew potions, and scribe scrolls. Eldritch spellcasters with an effective caster level of 9 or more can create permanent magic items. Eldritch spellcasters with an effective caster level of 11 or more can create constructs, create undead, crossbreed monsters, and cast ritual magic.

#### Saving Throw Progression

Eldritch classes (e.g. those for which the Eldritch category is the highest rating) use a new saving throw progression, the eldritch progression. If the Eldritch category’s rating is tied with another category, it takes precedence. The following rules apply to classes using the eldritch saving throw progression:
*	The class will have INT and/or WIS as one of its prime requisites.
*	The class will be able to use all magic items usable by either clerics or mages.
*	The class will gain proficiencies at the same rate as clerics.
*	After 8th level, the class will require an additional 150,000 XP per level to advance.
*	After 9th level, the class will gain 1 hit point per level.  
*	When selecting strongholds, an Eldritch value of 2+ qualifies the class for either a fortified church or a sanctum.

#### Converting Arcane Classes to Eldritch Classes

Since the XP Cost for the Arcane and Eldritch Values are identical, classes from ACKS Core or Player’s Companion with 1 or more points in the Arcane Value can be converted into Heroic Fantasy classes by substituting an equivalent number of points in the Eldritch value. The class’s level progression, Hit Dice, and attack throw progression are unchanged. If the class uses the mage saving throw progression and proficiency progression, substitute the cleric progression instead. Replace the mage spell progression (or fraction thereof) with the Nobiran wizard spell progression (or fraction thereof). Instead of selecting its spell repertoire from the arcane spell list, the class selects from the eldritch spells list (p. XX), and it becomes subject to the rules for the shades of magic (p. XX). In exchange, the class gains either spellsinging or bonus class powers.

### Ceremonial Value

|Value|	Ceremonial|	XP Cost
| :- | :- | :-
|4|	Loremaster|	2,000
|3|	Mage|	1,000
|2|	Runemaker|	500
|1|	½ level Runemaker|	250
|0|	none|	0

The Ceremonial Value allows the class to perform eldritch ceremonies, to create talismans and trinkets to store magical effects (see Ceremonial Magic, p. xx), and to engage in magical research.

**Ceremonial 1:** A Ceremonial Value of 1 gives the class one class power along with the ability to perform eldritch ceremonies and engage in magical research as a runemaker of ½ the character’s actual class level, rounded up. For instance, at 5th level, the character has the abilities of a 3rd level runemaker. The class uses its effective ceremonialist level (½ class level) for purposes of level-dependent ceremony ranges, durations, and damage.  

**Ceremonial 2:** A Ceremonial Value of 2 points gives the class two class powers along with the ability to perform eldritch ceremonies and engage in magical research as a runemaker.

**Ceremonial 3:** A Ceremonial Value of 3 gives the class three class powers along with the ability to perform eldritch ceremonies and engage in magical research as a loremaster. However, use the mage progression instead of the (superior) loremaster progression to determine the number of ceremonies per day at each level. The class still uses its full class level for all level-dependent ceremony ranges, durations, and damages.  

**Ceremonial 4:** A Ceremonial Value of 4 gives the class four class powers along with the ability to perform eldritch ceremonies and engage in magical research as a loremaster.

The selection of class powers received from the Ceremonial Value may be exchanged for a larger selection at a higher level of experience, or may be traded in for the ability to turn undead at the effective caster level.

#### Ceremonial Performance and Magic Research

Ceremonialists select their ceremonies from the eldritch spell list and are susceptible to corruption (see Shades of Magic, p. XX, and Ceremonial Magic, p. XX). They may collect and use divine power as clerics. Ceremonialists with an effective caster level of 1 or more can create trinkets. Ceremonialists with an effective caster level of 5 or more can research spells, brew potions, scribe scrolls, and create talismans. Ceremonialists with an effective caster level of 9 or more can create permanent magic items. Ceremonialists with an effective caster level of 11 or more can create constructs, create undead, crossbreed monsters, and cast ritual magic.

#### Saving Throw Progression

Ceremonial classes (e.g. those for which the Ceremonial category is the highest rating) use a new saving throw progression, the occultist progression. If the Ceremonial category’s rating is tied with another category, it takes precedence, except to Eldritch.

The following rules apply to classes using the occultist saving throw progression:
*	The class will have either INT or WIS as one of its prime requisites.
*	The class will be able to use all magic items usable by either clerics or mages.
*	The class will gain proficiencies at the same rate as clerics.
*	After 8th level, the class will require an additional 100,000 XP per level to advance.
*	After 9th level, the class will gain 1 hit point per level.  
*	When selecting strongholds, a Ceremonial value of 2+ qualifies the class for either a fortified church or a sanctum.

#### Converting Divine Classes to Ceremonial Classes

Since the XP Cost for the Divine and Ceremonial Values are identical, classes from ACKS Core or Player’s Companion with 1 or more points in the Divine Value can be converted into Heroic Fantasy classes by substituting an equivalent number of points in the Ceremonial value. The class’s level progression, Hit Dice, attack throw progression, saving throw progression, and proficiencies are unchanged. The class gains the ability to use magic items usable by mages.

Instead of casting spells from its class spell list, however, the class now can perform ceremonies drawn from the eldritch spells list (p. XX) and it becomes subject to the rules for the shades of magic (p. XX). The class should be assigned a tradition appropriate to its class powers and flavor. It replaces its divine spell progression with the eldritch ceremony progression. The class is no longer subject to its Divine Value Code. Other changes may be desirable for cosmetic reasons.

#### Arcane and Divine Ceremonialists

The Ceremonial Value above is for eldritch ceremonialists. Should the Judge wish to use ceremonialists in campaigns with arcane and divine spellcasters, make the following modifications:
*	An arcane ceremonialist (e.g. one who performs arcane ceremonies) has the spell progressions and XP Costs listed above, but he gains no class powers; cannot use divine power; cannot use cleric magic items; and uses the mage saving throw progression.
*	A divine ceremonialist (e.g. one who performs divine ceremonies) has the class powers and spell progressions of a divine caster. He cannot crossbreed monsters or use mage-only magic items. The category’s XP costs are 400, 200, 100, and 50 at Value 4, 3, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Halfling Custom Classes

Halflings are a race of diminutive and insular humanoids noted for their love of food, wealth, and comfort and their dislike of big people, strangers, and travel. Descending from human and dwarven stock, they stand about 3’ tall, with ruddy skin, dark hair, and brown or black eyes.  Among the most hirsute of the humanoid races, halflings cultivate their body hair the way dwarves cultivate their beards. Well-groomed foot hair is the mark of a halfling of fine breeding. Halflings live in small, close-knit communities of hill burrows with big, round windows. These “halfling holes” are a compromise between a dwarven heritage that craves the security of thick earth overhead and a human bloodline clamoring for sun and space.

#### Requirements

All halfling classes require a minimum Dexterity 9 or better.

#### Class Category Values

**Fighting:** Halflings with narrow weapon selections are limited to choosing from the following weapons: bola, dagger, darts, hand axe, javelin, sling, short bow, short sword. Halflings with broad weapon selections can also choose battle axe, crossbow, mace, or sword. (Also see the Undersized racial weakness, below.) Halflings cannot allocate more than 2 points to Fighting.

**Arcane:** Halflings may not allocate points to the Arcane value.

**Eldritch:** Halflings may not allocate points to the Eldritch value.

#### Halfling Value

When building a halfling custom class, assign between 0 and 4 build points to the class’s Halfling Value. These points represent the degree by which the members of the class embody archetypical halfling characteristics.

|Value|	Halfling|	XP Cost
| :- | :- | :-
|4|	Halfling 4|	-150
|3|	Halfling 3|	-225
|2|	Halfling 2|	-300
|1|	Halfling 1|	-375
|0|	Halfling 0|	-450

**Halfling 0:** At Halfling 0, all halflings gain the following halfling custom powers:

*	**Child-like**: Any halfling character suffers -2 to loyalty and morale from any non-halfling henchman, but gains +2 to loyalty and morale from any halfling henchman. This does not affect their reaction rolls.
*	**Demi-human Ancestry**: Due to their dwarven ancestry, halflings gain a +1 bonus on saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells.
*	**Difficult to Corrupt**:  Halfling crave comfort and security far to much to be able to descend into dastardly wickedness. They suffer only ½ the usual amount of Corruption from spending time in sinkholes of evil (p. XX), using evil magic items (p. XX), or suffering the effects of corrupting dreams (p. XX).
*	**Easily Encumbered**: Halflings have a base movement rate of 90’. Halflings can only carry 3 stone without becoming encumbered. When carrying 4 stone their encounter movement rate is reduced to 60’. When carrying 5-6 stone, their encounter movement rate is reduced to 45’. When carrying 7 stone or more, their encounter movement rate is reduced to 30’. A halfling can carry a maximum of 12 stone, modified by its Strength bonus or penalty.
*	**Halfling Tongues**: All halflings speak the common tongue, their native tongue, and three bonus languages, selected from the following list based on their shire’s proximity to other races and realms: Bugbear, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goblin, Human (various), Hobgoblin, Kobold, Orc.
*	**Heroic Breakfast**: Once per day a halfling can recover his base healing rate in hp by consuming a meal accompanied by alcohol, coffee, or tea. This recovery is in addition to any hit points gained from complete rest.
*	**Underfoot**: Because of their small size, halflings can more easily avoid attacks by big, clumsy creatures. Monsters of larger than man-sized suffer a -2 penalty to their attack throws against halflings.
*	**Short-Statured**: Due to their short stature, halflings may never wield large-sized weapons such as arbalests, great axes, morning stars, lances, longbows, polearms, staffs, or two-handed swords, and must use two hands when wielding medium-sized weapons such as battle axes, maces, and swords.
*	**Weak**: Halflings have a -4 penalty to proficiency throws to open doors and other feats of strength and they roll one die size smaller than normal for their Hit Dice (d8 becomes d6; d6 becomes d4; d4 becomes d2).

Additional points allocated to the Halfling Value represents the halfling’s expertise in certain specialized skills and abilities that are shared by word of mouth between halfling adventurers, free spirits, and travelers. Each point provides one halfling skill selected from the following: Find Traps, Hide in Shadows, Hear Noise, Move Silently, Open Locks, or Remove Traps (as thief); Accuracy, Difficult to Spot, or Evade Wilderness Encounters (as explorer);  or Arcane Dabbling, Beast Friendship, Magical Music, Passing Without Trace, Precise Shooting, Running, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling (as class proficiency); or Placating, a special halfling-only class power.

**Placating:** A halfling may use disarming  words, glib talk, or submissive body language to avoid being attacked. A halfling may not attack while placating, but may walk at half speed, or perform an action in lieu of moving, such as standing up from being knocked down, picking an item off the ground, or retrieving an item from a pack or sack. A halfling may not placate if he, or any other halflings in his party, have already attacked an opponent during the present encounter. When a halfling is placating, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the halfling must attempt a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack the halfling normally that round. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the halfling that round and will attack another creature instead. Area effects may still affect the halfling. Mindless creatures and fantastic creatures of animal intelligence cannot be placated, but ordinary animals and all sapient creatures are susceptible to a halfling's cringing placation.

>EXAMPLE: The Halfling Burglar is built with class category values of HD 1, Fighting 1b, Thief 2, Halfling 3. The HD 1 value would normally yield 1d6 hp per level, but the Weak class power reduces this to 1d4 hp per level. The Fighting 1b Broad weapon selection is traded down to Narrow weapon selection in exchange for 2 class powers. Therefore the Halfling Burglar receives 2 class powers, 5 thief skills, and 3 halfling skills, for a total of 10 special abilities. As a 7-point racial class build, Halfling Burglars are limited to the 10th level of experience. They require (500 + 500 + 400 - 225) 1,175 XP to advance to level 2.

>EXAMPLE: The Halfling Bounder is built with class category values of HD 2, Fighting 2, Halfling 4. The HD 1 value would normally yield 1d8 hp per level, but the Weak class power reduces this to 1d6 hp per level. The Fighting 2 Unrestricted weapon selection is traded down to Broad weapon selection in exchange for 1 class power. Therefore the Halfling Bounder receives 1 class power and 4 halfling skills, for a total of 5 special abilities. As an 8-point racial build, Halfling Bounders are limited to the 8th level of experience. They require (1000 + 1000 + 150 - 150) 2,000 XP to advance to level 2.

#### Experience Point Progression After 8th Level

Halflings decrease the amount of experience required to gain each level after 8th by 25,000XP.

### Elf and Zaharan Custom Classes

Points allocated to the Elf or Zaharan Value can stack with points allocated to either the Arcane or the Eldritch Value for purposes of spellcasting, class powers, magical research, strongholds, and magic item usability, if desired. Choose which of the two values the Elf or Zaharan Value will stack with when the class is created. Add the two values to find the class’s effective Eldritch abilities. Because of their innate magical power, the XP Cost for the Eldritch Value is reduced by 125XP for elven classes.

> ### The Math Behind the Math<br><br>
>The following information is provided for those Judges who like to understand the mathematics that power ACKS. It is not necessary to the enjoyment of ACKS or the Heroic Fantasy Handbook.<br><br>
In the Player’s Companion, Divine Value 2 offers the magical progression of a cleric, Divine Value 3 offers magical progression 33% better than that of a cleric, and Divine Value 4 offers magical progression 50% better than that of a cleric. In comparison, the pattern of magical progressions for the Ceremonialist Value seems completely arbitrary: Ceremonial Value 2 offers the magical progression of a runemaker; Ceremonial Value 3 offers the magical progression of a mage; and Ceremonial Value 4 offers the magical progression of a loremaster. There seems no apparent logic in switching from runemaker to mage to loremaster progression. In fact, the Ceremonial Value follows the exact same pattern of magical progressions used for the Divine Value in the Player’s Companion. The math is simply hidden in the magical progressions.<br><br>
For each progression, what we did was add up the total spell levels granted per day per level, apply a discount value at each level (because characters spend more time at low levels than high), and sum the totals. Comparing these totals, you will see that the mage’s magical progression is approximately 33% better than that of the runemaker’s, and that the loremaster’s is approximately 50% better than that of the runemaker’s. The exact comparisons are shown below. (114.19 / 85.99 = 133%; 127.46 / 85.99 = 151%).<br><br>
As the table shows, the symmetries of the math extend into the progressions of the loremaster and Nobiran wizard. Because the magical progression of a mage is 33% better than that of a runemaker, conversely a runemaker’s magical progressions is (1/1.33) 75% of a mage’s. Since a loremaster is supposed to be 50% better than a runemaker, and 0.75 x 1.51 = 1.132, an elegant byproduct of this math is that the magical progression for a loremaster and the progression of a Nobiran wizard can be made equal, as the Nobiran wizard progression yields almost exactly that.

**Beastmaster:** HD 1, Fighting 2, and Thievery 1 yields a 1,700 XP cost with fighter attack and saving throws. Thievery 1 grants three class powers. Armor selection is reduced to “none” for four class powers (+600 XP). Weapon selection is reduced to “narrow” for three class powers (+450 XP). Fighting styles are reduced to two in exchange for one class power (+150 XP). One class weakness is taken to gain one class power. This yields 12 class powers and a final XP cost of 2,900.

**Berserker:** HD 2 and Fight 2 yields a 2,000 XP cost with fighter attack and saving throws. Armor selection is reduced to “narrow” for two class powers (+300 XP). Damage bonus is reduced to one type for one class power (+150 XP). Fighting styles reduced to two types for one class power (+150 XP). Weapon selection reduced to “broad” for one class power (+150 XP). This yields five class powers. Greater Berserkergang ability requires one class power, leaving four class powers. One class power is traded for powers at 5th and 9th level, leaving three powers at 1st level in addition to Greater Berserkergang. Final XP cost is 2,750.

**Chosen** – HD 1, Fighter 2, and Thief 1 yields a 1,700 XP cost with fighter attack and saving throws. Thievery 1 grants three class powers. Armor selection is reduced to “restricted” for three class powers (+450 XP). Weapon selection is reduced to “narrow” for three class powers (+450 XP). This yields nine class powers. Six class powers at 1st level are traded for one class power at every level after 1st.  Final XP cost is 2,600.

**The Math Behind the Math:** The Chosen’s trade-offs dos not follow the rules as written in Player’s Companion. The PC rules slightly subsidize the number of powers available when making trade offs. For instance, a 1st level power ought to trade for one power at 4th and one at 11th, but Player’s Companion grants one at 4th and one at 10th. The trade-off subsidy is intended to encourage more trade-offs and is balanced by the fact that most campaigns rarely reach the highest levels (despite my best design efforts to encourage it). When taken to the extremes used by the Chosen, however, the subsidy yields too many powers at high levels for play balance. Therefore the Chosen is built using unsubsidized trade-offs. The unsubsidized trade-offs are 2nd/13th, 3rd/12th, 4th/11th, 5th/10th, 6th/9th, and 7th/8th. The Chosen is thus built with three class powers at 1st level, and six trade offs.<br>
If you want to test the class out according to the PC trade off rules, then trade one power at 1st level for powers at 2nd and 12th; one at 1st for powers at 3rd and 11th; one at 1st for powers at 4th and 10th; one at 1st for powers at 5th and 9th; one at 1st for powers at 6th and 8th; and one at 1st for two powers at 7th. Then trade one power at 7th for powers at 9th and 13th. Then trade one power at 9th for two powers at 12th. Then trade both powers at 12th for two powers at 13th and two powers at 14th. The result is three powers at 1st level; one additional power at each of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th level; three powers at 13th level; and two powers at 14th level. Using the small subsidy creates an over-powered class by 14th level.

**Ecclesiastic:** Thievery 1 and Ceremonial 3 yields a 1,200 XP cost with mage attack throws and ceremonial saving throws. Turn undead is retained. Thievery 1 grants three class powers. Final XP cost is set at 1,250 XP to maintain compatibility with ACKS and Player’s Companion classes, which round 1,200 XP to 1,250 XP in all cases.

**Elven Spellsinger:** Thievery 1, Eldritch 3, and Elf 1 yields a 2,700 XP cost with mage attack throws and eldritch saving throws. (Remember that elves reduce the cost of Eldritch value by 125 XP.)

## Custom Spells

Virtually all the new spells in this supplement were built using rules in the ACKS Player’s Companion. Listed below are the effects and factors used to build the spells appearing in this supplement were constructed. Certain types of spells, though common in traditional fantasy games, are uncommon in heroic fantasy. Other types of effects were either new or had not previously been calculated in the Player’s Companion. Therefore, certain base costs and costs factors had to be created or revised. These are summarized before each type of spells, while their use is noted in italics in the spell builds.

#### Blast Effect Notes

**Deafen:**  A deafened creature is easy to sneak up on, and suffers a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.  Due to its inability to hear itself, a deafened creature has a -4 penalty on ceremony throws and spellsinging throws. A deafened creature has a 2 in 6 chance of failing any attempt to cast a spell, read a scroll, or utter a command word.

**Knockdown:** A prone creature can move, but only to crawl at a movement rate of 5’, to take an action in lieu of moving, or to end the condition by using an action in lieu of moving to stand up. A prone creature that is engaged is subject to the movement restrictions of being engaged, so it can only crawl if using defensive movement, and cannot stand up in lieu of moving. A prone creature can attack, but suffers a -4 penalty on its attack throws. A prone creature can stand up in lieu of attacking. A prone creature can be backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. Attack throws against prone creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker backstabs the stunned creature. The stunned creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from backstab. The conditions is ended immediately when the creature stands up.

**Nausea:** A nauseated creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak. A nauseated creature can move away from the source of nausea (or take actions in lieu of moving to relieve themselves of whatever is inducing the nausea), but cannot otherwise move. They are still able to defend themselves. These rules revise and replace the rules for nausea found in the Player’s Companion spell stinking cloud.

#### Death Effect Notes

**Animate Dead:** The animate dead spell allows the caster may animate a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to twice his caster level each time he casts this spell. However, in the Player’s Companion the spell is incorrectly built to animate a number of HD of undead equal to just caster level, as reprinted below.

> animate dead target as undead skeleton/zombie (10), target 1 HD worth of creature per level (x1.75), range 0’  (x0.4), duration 1 day (x7), no saving throw (x1), arcane (x1), total cost 49 not 1 HD per level as shown in the Player’s Companion build.  

To correct this error, the cost of animate dead effect has been reduced from 10 to 5 points, and a new targeting factor of 2 HD per level has been added. The spell is therefore properly built as

>animate dead target as undead skeleton/zombie (5), target 2 HD worth of creature per level (x3.5), range 0’  (x0.4), duration 1 day (x7), no saving throw (x1), arcane (x1), total cost 49.

This correction impacts the effects of deathless minion, which has been revised in this rulebook (see below and p. XX).

**Choking/Vomiting:** A choking or vomiting creature a cannot attack, cast spells, move, or speak. However, it can still defend itself. This effect replaces the effect “held helpless” effect found in the Player’s Companion spell choking grip. Holding a target helpless is now a 40-point effect.

**Helpless:** A helpless creature cannot attack, cast spells, or move. A helpless creature gains no benefit to its AC from its shield (if any). A helpless creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against helpless creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the helpless creature. The helpless creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against helpless creatures automatically hit if the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the helpless creature. If the attacker is not engaged, and his attack is capable of damaging the helpless creature, then the helpless creature may be automatically slain. The attacker may not cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the helpless creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

#### Death Targeting Notes

Attack throw required to hit target is erroneously listed with a targeting factor of x0.25 in Player’s Companion. The correct targeting factor is 0.x75.

### Enchantment Effect Notes

**Confused:** A confused creature rolls 2d6 each round to determine its action. On a roll of 2-5, it attacks its enemies, on a 6-8 it does nothing but babble incoherently, and a 9-12 it attacks its own allies. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking the confused creature. A confused creature who is attacked automatically retaliates on its next initiative. A confused creature which is restrained, imprisoned, alone, or otherwise can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.

**Frightened:** A frightened creature cannot attack, cast spells, or speak (except to make exclamations of peril and warning such as “DRAGON!” or “Flee for your life!”). A frightened creature will run from the source of its fear at its full movement rate until the condition ends. If a frightened creature cannot flee, its cowers in terror. It suffers a -2 penalty to AC and cannot attack, cast spells, move, or take any other actions until the condition ends. An engaged creature that is frightened will cower in terror until it is able to disengage with defensive movement.

**Helpless:** A helpless creature cannot attack, cast spells, or move. A helpless creature gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). A helpless creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against helpless creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the helpless creature. The helpless creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. Melee attack throws against helpless creatures automatically hit if the attacker is of the same or larger size category than the helpless creature. If the attacker is not engaged, and his attack is capable of damaging the helpless creature, then the helpless creature may be automatically slain. The attacker may not cleave thereafter, however. Otherwise, the helpless creature may be dealt the attack’s ordinary damage.

**Infuriated:** An infuriated creature will attack any creatures it can detect. It will prioritize attacking whichever creature has most recently damaged it, but otherwise will attack the closest target. If the creature has no eligible targets, it will wait motionless in seething fury until a target presents itself. An infuriated creature gains a +2 bonus to its attack throws but suffers a -2 penalty to its AC due to its mindless rage. An infuriated creature is immune to fear and ignores morale rolls. An infuriated creature cannot speak.

**Mesmerized:** A mesmerized creature cannot attack, cast spells, move, or speak. A mesmerized creature can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. A mesmerized creature gains no benefit to its AC from its DEX or shield (if any). All attack throws against mesmerized creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the mesmerized creature. The mesmerized creature is dealt the attack’s ordinary damage, or the attack’s ordinary damage multiplied by two or more from ambush or backstab. These rules revise and replace the rules for mesmerization found in Player’s Companion spell hypnotic pattern.

**Paralyzed:**  A paralyzed creature cannot speak and is helpless (as above).

**Slumbering:** A slumbering creature cannot see, hear, or speak and is helpless (as above). The condition is ended immediately if the slumbering creature is attacked, damaged, or moved, regardless of the duration of the spell.

The targeting factor for 480’ diameter sphere revises and replaces the targeting factor for that area of effect in the Player’s Companion.

#### Summoning Effect Notes

The spell creation system in the Player’s Companion affords wide variety in the type of summoning spells that can be designed. However, most of the summoning spells in HFH have been designed in one of three ways, inspired by common tropes for summoning in the literature, and balanced against each other.

**Callings:** Spells that summon creatures to arrive by means of their own locomotion with a duration of 1 day. If the same calling is cast again, it keeps the same creature(s) around for another day. Callings are white magic, and are used by Gandalf and Radagast in the Lord of the Rings.

**Conjurations:** Spells that summon powerful creatures to serve the caster for a short period of time. Conjured creatures can be very powerful, but are actively hostile and must be controlled through concentration. Any given conjuration can only be cast once per day. Conjurations were inspired by the wizardry of Master of the Five Magics and the Daimos school of The Prince of Nothing trilogy.

**Summonings:** Spells that summon one or more creatures for extended periods of time. Summonings are limited by frequency of casting, so that a caster cannot have an endless number of summoned creatures dispatched at once. Thoth-Amon performs a summoning in the Conan short story “The Phoenix on the Sword”.

We highly recommend that if the Judge adds any new monster-summoning spells to his campaign they should follow the guidelines for callings, conjurations, or summonings.

> This spell was challenging to design, as it required matching the radius of the protection effect to the size of the wall effect. We started by calculating the volume of the 10’ radius protection effect, (4/3 x 3.14 x 103) or 1,333 cubic feet. We then calculated the volume of a sphere 9’11” in radius (4/3 x 3.14 x 9.173) or 1,300 cubic feet. From there we were able to calculate the volume of the “wind wall” itself as a spherical shell with a radius of 10’ and a thickness of 1”, being (1333 cubic feet – 1300 cubic feet) 33 cubic feet. Since we knew the wall would be 1” (0.083’) thick, that meant that the area of the wall had to be at least 33 cubic feet /.083 feet = 397 square feet. A 500 square foot wall is therefore large enough to satisfy the needs of the effect.
