# Chapter 6: Heroic Monsters

*What he had taken for a part of the tower was the shoulder of the Dragon of Pendor as he uncurled his bulk and lifted himself slowly up.  When he was all afoot his scaled head, spike-crowned and triple-tongued, rose higher than the broken tower's height, and his taloned forefeet rested on the rubble of the town below. His scales were grey-black, catching the daylight like broken stone. Lean as a hound he was and huge as a hill. Ged stared in awe. There was no song or tale could prepare the mind for this sight.* – A Wizard of Earthsea, Ursula K. LeGuin

As noted in ACKS (p. 151), monsters with similar characteristics are grouped into monster types. The Heroic Companion introduces two new monster types (demon and plant). A creature can belong to multiple types.

Demons are creatures summoned from the Outer Darkness. Demons are resistant (take half damage from) attacks based on cold, electricity, fire, and gas. All demons possess infravision (90 feet) and telepathy, which allows them to communicate with any creatures they encounter. Demons are unholy beings that can be held at bay by protection from evil, dispelled with dispel evil and turned by clerics as Infernal.

Plants are sentient vegetable creatures. Plans are immune to all charm, sleep, and hold spells, to stunning, and to poisons not designed to work on plants. They are vulnerable to spells that affect plants.

Báleygr (Old Jutlandic for “flaming-eyed”) are dreadful demons of smoke and flame, resembling 12’ tall iron-skinned minotaurs with fiery eyes and stunted black wings. Báleygr rejoice in war and bloodshed, and typically carry giant-sized weapons of black metal in each hand, favoring a sword, axe, or mace in one hand and a whip in the other. Some sages believe that the báleygr were once guardians of the Elemental Sphere of Fire, and that they were turned to darkness by Bel, called the Slaughterprince, the Chthonic god of battle. Others claim they are born of the hates and fears of men, and grow stronger as the world descends into chaos. Whatever their origins, báleygr are fearsome foes who bring ruin to any that stand against them.

At will, a báleygr can surround itself with an aura of elemental fire and/or shrouding smoke. When the báleygr’s  aura of elemental fire is active, creatures within 25’ of the báleygr take 1d8 points of fire damage if they begin their initiative in its aura, or move into it on their initiative. When its aura of shrouding smoke is active, the báleygr is hidden by the smoke and any creatures (other than the báleygr) within 25’ of it are blinded, unless able to see invisible. The báleygr may have both auras active, if desired.

The mere sight of a báleygr can cause panic in its opponents. When a báleygr appears, all creatures with less than 1 Hit Dice automatically flee at their running movement rate for 30 rounds with no saving throw. All creatures with 1 – 3 Hit Dice must save versus Paralysis or flee at their running movement rate for 30 rounds.  All creatures with more than 3 Hit Dice must save versus Paralysis or suffer a -2 penalty to attack and saving throws while the báleygr remains in sight. As a báleygr terrifying presence is preternatural, it functions even through the obscurement of its aura of shrouding smoke.

In combat, a báleygr will strike with one of its giant-sized weapons. Targets within 10’ will be attacked with its sword, axe, or mace for 4d6 points of damage. More distant targets, up to 30’, will be attacked with its whip for 2d6 points of damage. Targets struck by the báleygr’s whip must make a saving throw versus Paralysis or be dragged adjacent to the báleygr.  Occasionally báleygr arm themselves with huge bows, with which they shoot flaming arrows. Báleygr’s bows have twice the range and accuracy of longbows and deal 4d6 points of fire damage on a successful attack. A báleygr’s weapons melt into slag if the creature is slain.

A báleygr is immune to death magic, fire, and ordinary weapons, and resistant (takes half damage) to acid, cold, and electricity. It possesses infravision (90’) and telepathy, which allows it to communicate with any creatures it encounters. It can be held at bay by protection from evil and turned as an infernal creature, but may make a saving throw versus Spells to ignore the effects of being turned. A summoned báleygr can be dispelled.

If encountered in a wilderness lair, a legion of báleygr will be led by a lord with AC 12, 16 HD, 80 hp, and a +4 bonus on damage rolls. A báleygr lord is worth 7,200 XP and has additional treasure of type Q. It has a 25% chance to be mounted on a mature adult red dragon; if so, generate the dragon’s characteristics and treasure separately.

Tales of a dark overlord fielding entire armies of báleygr mounted on dragons and led by a terrible giant-sized prince are generally considered fanciful even by the standards of adventurers.

Cacodemons are living horrors from the Outer Darkness brought to our world by black magic, evil prayer, or terrible suffering and calamity. Utterly alien and unspeakably vile, they have been known to mankind by many names: gremlin, incubus, demon, devil, fiend. Civilized adults, living in the safe realms of Law, may dismiss cacodemons as mere myths and legends, but the learned must endure the terror of knowing they are real.

Cacodemon Characteristics by Age Category

Cacodemons range in power from chaotic spawn, no more fearsome than a gnoll, to archfiends capable of destroying dragons. Demonologists have codified this range into ten different ranks. A cacodemon’s characteristics primarily depend on its rank. See the Primary Cacodemon Attributes and Secondary Cacodemon Attributes tables, below.  

**Primary Cacodemon Attributes**

**Cacodemon Body Form**
A cacodemon’s movement rate and attack routine are determined by its body form. Some occultists argue that cacodemons have no true body form, and that it is the summoner’s will which imposes shape upon their formless souls. Others argue that as creatures of Chaos, cacodemons come in every body form imaginable.  Whatever the case, cacodemons most often appear in one of five basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of ten common body form configurations. These are:

*Arachnine*: Arachnine cacodemons resemble giant spiders, with chitinous segmented eight-legged bodies,  fanged chelicerae, web-making spinnerets, and up to eight insect-like eyes. Winged arachnine cacodemons add a pair of dragonfly-like wings. A wingless arachnine has a movement rate of 60’. A winged arachnine has a movement rate of 60’ and a flying movement rate of 120’. In either case, arachnines can climb at their base movement rate. An arachnine cacodemon’s attack routine consists of a bite attack. Arachnine cacodemons may select the poison special ability if desired.

*Humanoid*: Humanoid cacodemons are bipedal, two-armed, two-legged creatures. Some are beautiful and majestic, resembling elves, men, or gods. Others are hideous to behold, resembling minotaurs, ogres, owlbears, or worse. If wings are present, they sprout from the shoulder blades; they are typically bat-like, but feathered avian wings and membranous insect wings are also possible. A wingless humanoid has a movement rate of 120’. A winged humanoid has a movement rate of 90’ and a flying movement rate of 240’. A humanoid’s attack routine consists of a pair of claw attacks and a bite attacks. Some humanoids may instead have a weapon attack, which deals damage as an arachnine bite attack.

*Monadine*: Monadine cacodemons appear as amorphous blobs of cytoplasmic ichor, capable of changing their shape, forming stalks, and extruding pseudopods. Some monadine cacodemons may have blinking eyes, agonized human faces, or pulsating organs visible on or within their cytoplasm. “Wingless” monadine have a movement rate of 30’. “Winged” monadine, capable of propelling themselves into the air and forming their bodies into a wing-like surface, gain a flying movement rate of 60’. In either case, monadine cacodemons can climb and swim at their base movement rate. A monadine’s attack routine consists of an envelopment by an extruded pseudopod. Monadine cacodemons may select the swallow attack special ability if desired.

*Scolopendrine*: Scolopendrine cacodemons resemble enormous carcass scavengers, with long segmented bodies with a pair of legs on every segment, terminating in a head festered with elongated mandibles and eight tentacle-like antenna. Winged scolopendrine gain a pair of membranous wings on every segment, granting a flying movement rate of 180’. A scolopendrine’s attack routine consists of eight tentacle attacks and a bite attack. Scolopendrine cacodemons may select the paralysis special ability if desired.

*Wyverine*: Wyverine cacodemons have bipedal body forms with two vestigial arms (like a tyrannosaur). If wings are present, they replace the arms (like a bat or bird). A wingless wyvernine cacodemon has a movement rate of 120’, while a winged wyvernine cacodemon has a movement rate of 90’ and a flying movement rate of 240’. A wyvern’s attack routine consists of either a bite and a tail attack or two talon attacks. Winged wyvernine cacodemons may select the dive attack special ability while wingless ones may select the berserk special ability.

Cacodemon Size, mass, and Carrying Capacity
A cacodemon’s mass (in pounds) is determined by its HD and its body mass exponent, according to the formula *mass = (HD x 10)BME*. The cacodemon’s weight then determines its carrying capacity and size category. Its carrying capacity is calculated according to the formula *carrying capacity = mass x CCF*. Size category is shown on the table below.

|Mass|	35 lbs or less|	36 to 400 lbs|	401 to 2,000 lbs|	2,001 to 8,000 lbs|	8,001 to 32,000 lbs|	More than 32,000 lbs
|:
|Size Category|	Small|	Man-Sized|	Large|	Huge|	Gigantic|	Colossal
|Length/Height	|Less than 2’ long/tall|	Less than 8’ long/tall|	8’ to 12’ long/tall|	12’ to 20’ long/tall|	20’ to 32’ long/tall|	32’ or more long/tall

A cacodemons’s size category determines its height and length. Wingspans of winged cacodemons will typically be three times length. Being magical creatures, cacodemons do not suffer an AC penalty for size category. Some cacodemons may be lighter and smaller than their HD and BME would indicate (Judge’s choice), but they may not be larger.

**Cacodemon Special Abilities**

Like all demons, cacodemons are resistant to (take half damage from) attacks based on cold, electricity, fire, and gas; have infravision (90 feet); and possess telepathy allowing them to communicate with any creatures they encounter.

In addition, all cacodemons have at least two other special abilities, one of them often derived from their body form. High-ranking cacodemons may have as many as five special abilities. Refer to the Secondary Cacodemon Attributes table for the number of special abilities the cacodemon should receive. Winged cacodemons lose one special ability to compensate for flight. The Judge may roll or select powers for the cacodemon from the list below, or make up his own. Note that some selections yield powers worth 1/8, 1/2, or 1/4 a special ability (*). The Judge should continue to roll or choose powers until the appropriate total number is chosen.

Spell-like special abilities count as fractions of a special ability each. Multiply ¼ x the level of the spell-like ability by the usage factor shown on the adjoining table.

EXAMPLE: A particular cacodemon can cast illusion at will (4th level, usage 1), command word at will (1st level, usage 1), mirror image once per day (2nd level, usage 0.4), and charm person once per day (1st level, usage 0.4). Its spell-like abilities count as [ (1/4 x 4 x 1) + (1/4 x 1 x 1) + (1/4 x 2 x 0.4) + (1/4 x 1 x 0.4) ] 1.55 abilities, rounded to 2.  

Whatever their special abilities, cacodemons are unholy beings that can be held at bay by protection from evil, dispelled with dispel evil and turned by clerics as Infernal.

|Usage| 	Usage Factor|	Usage|	Usage Factor
|:
|At will|	1|	1/day|	0.4
|1/turn|	0.8|	1/week|	0.3
|1/3 turns|	0.7|	1/month	|0.2
|1/hour|	0.6|	1/season	|0.1
|3/day|	0.5|	1/year	|0.05

**Cacodemon Speech Capability**

Refer to the Secondary Cacodemon Attributes table for the probability of speech and the spells per day available for cacodemons of various ages. The older the cacodemon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. All cacodemons that can speak know Common and two other languages. Cacodemons that speak may also cast eldritch spells. Cacodemons always know the same number of eldritch spells that they can cast per day. Different cacodemons favor different types of spells, but black enchantments such as incite madness, infuriate beast, inspire horror, endless slumber, feeblemind, and enslave are common.  

Cacodemons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having two additional special abilities for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the XP awards for Fiends and Archfiends, which always can speak and cast spells). If all cacodemons are unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then cacodemons who would be capable of speech should gain an additional special ability instead.

| Roll	| Special Ability
|:
| 01-02| Acid (1): The cacodemon’s attacks destroy non-magical armor or clothing on a successful hit. A non-magical weapon that strikes the cacodemon dissolves immediately after dealing damage. Magical weapons and armor are allowed a saving throw using the wearer’s save versus Death, adding any magical bonus to the roll if applicable.
| 03-04| Aura (1): The cacodemon is surrounded by a damaging aura that deals damage to susceptible creatures each round. The aura has a radius of 2’ per HD, and deals 1d8 damage per round. Roll 1d8 for the type of aura: 1 – fire; 2 – lightning; 3 – freezing vapors; 4 – poison vapor; 5 – scouring wind; 6 – acid; 7 – blistering steam; 8 – fetid gas.
| 05| 	Berserk (1): The cacodemon gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls and is immune to fear. Its morale score is raised to +4.
| 06-07| 	Bonus Attack (Varies): The cacodemon gains one or more bonus attacks. Roll 1d6: 1-3 one bonus attack dealing damage equal to its primary attack, 4-6 two bonus attacks each dealing damage equal to its secondary attack (or half its primary attack). If the bonus attack increases the cacodemon’s average damage to more than 4 points per HD, it counts as 1 special ability. Otherwise it counts as 1/4 special abilities.
| 08-09| 	Breath Weapon (1): The cacodemon gains a cacodemon-like breath weapon usable 3/day. The breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage per HD of the cacodemon, with a saving throw v. Blast reducing damage by half. Roll 1d8 for the type of breath weapon or choose: 1 – fire; 2 – lightning; 3 – freezing vapors; 4 – poison vapor; 5 – scouring wind; 6 – acid; 7 – blistering steam; 8 – fetid gas. Area of effect and special properties are as per a cacodemon.
| 10-13	| Charge (1/4): The cacodemon is capable of making charge attacks that deal double damage. Choose one natural attack type for the charge.
| 14-15| Charm (1): The cacodemon can enslave victims to its will 3/day or by gaze. The target must save v. Spells or be totally enthralled by the cacodemon. If the cacodemon has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the cacodemon has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2.
| 16-17	| Class Powers/Proficiencies (Varies): The cacodemon gains 1d4 class powers or proficiencies, selected based on the cacodemon’s overall design (Judge’s choice), excluding spellcasting. If the cacodemon has all the powers of a class, it counts as 1 special ability. Otherwise, each class power counts as one 1/8 special ability.
| 18-19| 	Energy Drain (2): Victims of the cacodemon’s primary attack lose 1 or more levels of experience. If the cacodemon has 6 HD or less, it drains 1 level of experience. If it has 7 HD or more, it drains 2 levels of experience.
| 20-23| 	Flying (1): The cacodemon is capable of flying at the movement rate noted for its body form. If it already flies, it becomes capable of making dive attacks that deal double damage. If a dive hits a victim smaller than itself, it grabs and carries him off, unless the victim makes a successful save v. Paralysis. If it already has a dive attack, re-roll.
| 24-25| 	Grab (1): Victims of the cacodemon’s primary attack must save v. Paralysis or be grabbed. Grabbed victims are helpless until they escape by making a successful saving throw v. Paralysis on their turn.
| 26-31| 	Hug (1/4): If the cacodemon hits with more than half its attacks during its attack sequence, it deals additional damage: 2d6 if man-sized, 2d8 if large, 2d10 if huge, 2d12 if gigantic, and 2d20 if colossal.
| 32-37| Immunity (Varies): The cacodemon gains an immunity. Roll 1d12: 1 – fire (1/4); 2 – lightning (1/4); 3 – cold (1/4); 4 – acid (1/4);  5 – sleep, charm, hold, and poison (1); 6 – fear (1/4); 7 – blunt weapons (1/4); 8 – edged weapons (1/4); 9 – piercing weapons (1/4); 10 – bronze/iron/wood weapons (3/4), 11 – all nonmagical weapons (1), 12 – all elemental effects (1). Re-roll if the cacodemon is already immune to the effect.
| 38| 	Incorporeal (1): The cacodemon is formless, weightless, and unable to interact with physical objects except through its attacks or special abilities. If an incorporeal cacodemon has 4 HD or less, it can only be harmed by silver weapons. If an incorporeal cacodemon has 5 HD or more, it can only be harmed by magical weapons. It may select energy drain and flying as special abilities.
| 39| Infectious (1/4): The cacodemon is able to transform its victims into others of its kind. Creatures slain by the cacodemon might rise as cacodemons of its type unless appropriate measures are taken; or victims suffering loss of half or more of their hit points to the cacodemon’s natural attacks might become a cacodemon of its type after 2d6 days.
| 40-41| 	Initiative (1): The cacodemon is extremely fast, and always has the initiative each round.
| 42-43| 	Invisibility (1): The cacodemon is naturally invisible. It may act freely, including attacking, without becoming visible.
| 44| 	Magic Resistance (1): The cacodemon gains magic resistance with a target value of (20-HD).
| 45-48| Ongoing Damage (1): Once the cacodemon has hit its victim, it does ongoing damage each round equal to its most damaging attack. Special effects (energy drain, poison, etc.) are not ongoing.
| 49-51| 	Paralysis (1): Victims of the cacodemon’s primary attack(s) must save v. Paralysis or be paralyzed. Roll 1d6: 1-2 paralysis lasts for 1d10 rounds, 3-6 paralysis lasts for 2d4 turns.
| 52-53| 	Petrification (2): Any victim that either (1-3) meets the cacodemon’s gaze or (4-6) is struck by the cacodemon’s attack(s) is required to make a saving throw v. Petrification or be turned to stone.
| 54-61| 	Poison (1): Victims of the cacodemon’s primary attack(s) must save v. Poison or die. If the cacodemon has 3 HD or less, the save is at +2. If the cacodemon has 9 HD or more, the save is at -2.
| 62-63| 	Regeneration (1): The cacodemon regenerates hit points each round, with the ability to re-attach lost limbs, unless the damage is of two particular types (usually fire and acid). The amount regenerated will be HD/2 per round.
| 64-68| 	Resistance (Varies): The cacodemon gains resistance to two effects. Roll 1d12: 1 – fire (1/8); 2 – lightning (1/8); 3 – cold (1/8); 4 – acid (1/8);  5 – sleep, charm, hold, and poison (1/2); 6 – fear (1/8); 7 – blunt weapons (1/8); 8 – edged weapons (1/8); 9 – piercing weapons (1/8); 10 – bronze/iron/wood weapons (3/8), 11 – all nonmagical weapons (1/2), 12 – all elemental effects (1/2). If the same effect is rolled twice, the cacodemon becomes immune (as above). Re-roll if the cacodemon is already immune to the effect.
| 69-71| 	Spellcasting (2): The cacodemon may cast spells as if it were a Zaharan sorcerer of the class level shown on the  Secondary Cacodemon Characteristics table. Re-roll if the cacodemon is already able to cast spells.
| 72-75| 	Spell-like Abilities: The cacodemon gains 1d4 spell-like abilities. Generate the abilities as if rolling for spell scrolls or select appropriate abilities based on the cacodemon’s other powers (Judge’s choice). Each spell-like ability counts as a fraction of a special ability. Multiply 2 x spell level x the usage factor (see below).
| 76-80| 	Stealth (1/4): The cacodemon is difficult to notice. Roll 1d6: 1-2 characters encountering the cacodemon at any time suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls; 3-4 characters encountering the cacodemon in its natural habitat suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls; 4-6 characters encountering the cacodemon in its natural habitat suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls.
| 81-83| 	Swallow Attack (1): The cacodemon can swallow whole victims smaller than itself on an unmodified attack throw of 19 or 20. A victim that is swallowed whole takes damage equal to the cacodemon’s most damaging attack each round until the cacodemon is killed or the victim dies.
| 84-86| 	Swift (1/4): The cacodemon moves rapidly. Its movement rate is increased by 30’ for every 120’ of base encounter movement
| 87-88| 	Terrifying (1): Any being seeing the cacodemon must succeed in a saving throw versus Paralysis or become paralyzed with dread. This affect passes if the cacodemon leaves the victim’s range of vision, or if the cacodemon engages in combat.
| 89-94| 	Tough: The cacodemon is unusually tough or hardy. Its AC is increased by 1d4 points. If this increases its AC to more than its HD x 1.5, this counts as a 1 special ability. Otherwise it counts as ¼ special ability.
| 95-99| 	Trample (1/4): The cacodemon gains a trample attack which it may use in lieu of its normal attack sequence. The trample attack should inflict an average of 2 hp of damage per HD the cacodemon possesses. The cacodemon gains a +4 bonus to attack man-sized targets when trampling. If the cacodemon is not at least large sized, re-roll.
| 100| 	Unusual (1): The cacodemon has a rare, unique, or special power determined by the Judge. Examples include the rust cacodemon’s ability to destroy metal armor and weapons, and the vampire’s ability to assume gaseous form when reduced to 0 hit points.

Cave krakens are frightening, octopus-like creatures often used by evil wizards to guard treasures in subterranean lakes and other bodies of water. They possess eight 12’ long tentacles, which are covered in wicked barbs. Tentacles that successfully strike a target constrict for 1d8 points of damage initially and then 1d8 per round thereafter until either the target is dead or the tentacle cut off. For every tentacle constricting a single target, the target suffers a -1 penalty to attack rolls.  A tentacle can be cut off if a total of 6 hit points or more of damage is dealt with one blow. If a cave kraken loses half or more of its tentacles, it will flee beneath the water, attacking again only if it is pursued or to defend any treasure it might be guarding.

Dragons are an ancient and dangerous reptilian species, capable of surviving for thousands of years, growing in size and power with each passing century. While all dragons belong to the same race of creatures and can inter-breed, dragons come in an astounding variety of shapes, colors, and powers. In certain worlds, they may be intelligent – and in those worlds they are often representative of the greatest evils those worlds have to offer. In other worlds, dragons are feral creatures of bestial instinct.  In every world, they are held in awe and terror as living embodiments of avarice, gluttony, and wrath.

**Dragon Characteristics by Habitat**
In the world of the Auran Empire, dragons are elemental creatures whose very bodies adapt to whatever habitat they choose to lair in. In other worlds, dragons might have evolved in different ways in different habitats, or might have been created at different times for different environments. In any case, a dragon’s color and its breath weapon (if any) usually reflect the terrain and climate of their habitats, and dragons are often grouped into general categories on this basis. For instance, dragons that dwell in glaciers or frigid tundra will often have white hides and freezing breath weapons, earning the name white dragons.

|Habitat|	Common Name|	Hide Color|	Breath Weapon
|:
|Any sinkhole of evil|	Wyrm|	Purple taupe, liver, charcoal, or black	|40’ long, 40’ wide, cloud, fetid gas
|Any pinnacle of good	|Metallic dragon	|Bronze, silver, electrum, or gold	|90’ long, 30’ wide, cone, fire
|Clouds, mountain peaks	|Blue dragon	|Sky blue, slate grey, cloud white	|100’ long, 5’ wide, line, lightning bolt
|Deserts, wastelands	|Brown dragon	|Burnt orange, copper, or sandy brown	|90’ long, 30’ wide, cone, scouring wind
|Oceans, lakes	|Sea dragon	|Sea green, teal, or cerulean blue	|90’ long, 30’ wide, cloud, blistering steam
|Glaciers, icy caves	|White dragon	|Ivory, pearl, or snow white	|90’ long, 30’ wide, cloud, freezing vapor
|Volcanoes, badlands	|Red dragon	|Flaming red, burnt orange, or charcoal|	90’ long, 30’ wide, cone, fire
|Woods, jungles	|Green dragon	|Moss green, olive, or forest green	|40’ long, 40’ wide, cloud, poison vapor
|Swamps, marshes	|Black dragon	|Green-grey, midnight green, or black	|100’ long, 5’ wide, line, acid

**Dragon Characteristics by Age Category**

A dragon’s characteristics primarily depend on its age. See the Primary Dragon Attributes and Secondary Dragon Attributes tables, below.

*Excluding special abilities gained from body form


**Dragon Body Form**

A dragon’s movement rate and attack routine are determined by its body form. Dragons come in four basic body forms, each of which has winged and wingless variants, for a total of eight possibly body form configurations. These are:

*Guivre:* A guivre has a limbless body form resembling a serpent. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. A guivre has a movement rate of 90’ and, if winged, a flying movement rate of 240’. A guivre’s attack routine consists of a bite and a tail attack. All guivres possess the constriction special ability.

*Lindworm:* A lindworm has a legless body form with two front claws resembling a worm lizard. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body. (That is, a winged lindworm has two front claws and two wings on a legless body, for a total of four limbs. A serpentine body form with two wings and no other limbs is a winged guivre.) A lindworm has a movement rate of 60’ and a burrowing movement rate of 30’; if winged, it also has a flying movement rate of 180’. A lindworm’s attack routine consists of a single very powerful bite attack. All lindworms possess the decapitating bite special ability.

*Wyverns:* A wyvern has a bipedal body form with two vestigial arms (like a tyrannosaur). If wings are present, they replace the arms (like a bat or bird). A wingless wyvern has a movement rate of 120’, while a winged wyvern has a movement rate of 90’ and a flying movement rate of 240’. A wyvern’s attack routine consists of either a bite and a tail attack and, if winged, two talon attacks. All winged wyverns possess the clutching claws special ability while all wingless wyverns possess the arm claws special ability.

*Monitor:* A monitor has a quadrupedal body form resembling a large lizard. If wings are present, they are an addition to the body (giving it a total of six limbs). A monitor has a movement rate of 90’ and, if winged, a flying movement rate of 240’. A monitor’s attack routine consists of a pair of claw attacks and a bite attack. All monitors gain one bonus special ability from their body form. This body form is sometimes called “draconic” or “true dragon” form.

*Only available if Massive Size special ability is taken.

**Dragon Special Abilities**

In addition to the special ability gained from their body form, all dragons have at least one other special ability. As they age, dragons become increasingly powerful and gain additional special abilities. One of these special abilities is usually, but not always, a breath weapon. However, winged dragons lose one special ability to compensate for the ability to fly. Refer to the Secondary Dragon Attributes table for the number of special abilities the dragon should receive. Select powers appropriate to the dragon’s habitat and alignment from the list below, or make up your own.

*Breath Weapon:* The dragon gains a breath weapon appropriate to its habitat. See Dragon Breath Weapons, below.

*Clutching Claws:* The dragon may make a dive attack with its claws (or talons), dealing double damage. If the dragon hits a creature smaller than itself with both its claw or talon attacks, the dragon automatically grabs the creature struck (no saving throw). To escape the dragon’s clutches, the character must make a successful saving throw versus Paralysis at -4. Grabbed humanoids, and any creatures with less than half the dragon’s Hit Dice, can be carried off. Only winged dragons with either claw or talon attacks can select this ability.

*Constriction:* On a successful tail attack, the dragon is able to constrict the victim in its snaky coils. On the dragon’s initiative each round thereafter, it may either release or squeeze the victim. If the dragon releases the victim, it may attack another creature with its tail instead. If the dragon squeezes the victim, the victim suffers additional damage as if struck by the dragon’s tail. A constricted victim may attempt to break out of the hold on its initiative in lieu of moving and attacking. Breaking out of the dragon’s hold requires a successful saving throw versus Paralysis. Constricted humanoids and creatures with less than half the dragon’s Hit Dice suffer a -4 penalty to the saving throw. Due to their small size, such creatures can be carried off during the dragon’s movement, and can be squeezed even if the dragon is casting a spell. Only dragons with tails can select this special ability.

*Decapitating Bite:* On a critical hit, the dragon’s bite may attempt to decapitate its target (in lieu of other critical hit effects). The character bitten must make a saving throw versus Death or die. Even if the saving throw is successful, the character will suffer quadruple damage from the bite.

*Draconic Persuasion:* Some dragons have a dangerous charisma about them – their voices are inviting, cloying, seductive, their bearing commanding, their eyes penetrating. Any creature that speaks with such a dragon must make a saving throw v. Spells. If the save fails, the creature is charmed. If the save succeeds, the creature is thereafter immune to that particular dragon’s draconic persuasion. Only dragons capable of speech may select this special ability.

*Elemental Aura:* The dragon is surrounded in a 5’ radius by an aura of elemental energy appropriate to its habitat (a red dragon might be wreathed in flame, for instance). Characters who begin their initiative within the aura, or enter it during their initiative, immediately suffer damage as if hit by a claw attack by a monitor-form dragon of the radiating dragon’s age category. Only dragons with breath weapons may select this special ability.

*Fear Aura:* When the dragon charges or flies overhead, it causes fear in its opponents. All creatures with less than 1 Hit Dice flee in panic for 4d6 turns. All creatures with 1-3 Hit Dice must save versus Paralysis or be paralyzed with fear. All creatures with more than 3 Hit Dice must save versus Paralysis or suffer a -1 to attack throws. The fear effects last until the dragon is slain or passes out of sight and sound.

*Gem-Encrusted Hide:* The dragon’s hide is coated with gemstones and coins from centuries of lying on its treasure pile. Because of this protection, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, but its movement is reduced by 30’.  The AC bonus increases to +3 when the dragon becomes Very Old, and +4 when the dragon becomes Venerable.

*Horrific Stench:* The dragon gives off a disgusting stench. Characters who begin their initiative, or move on their initiative to, within 20’ of the dragon must make a Saving Throw versus Poison or be queasy from by its overwhelming stench. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. Queasy characters suffer -3 to attack throws and damage rolls while in, and for 1d4+4 rounds after, leaving the dragon’s vicinity.

*Invulnerable:* The dragon’s innate power protects it from most attacks. The dragon cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

*Massive Size:* The dragon is of enormous size for its age. Its Hit Dice are increased by 2, with a commensurate increase in damage from its attack routine. A dragon may take this special ability multiple times, representing a truly colossal specimen.

*Paralyzing Blows:* Up to the three of the dragon’s attacks can channel negative energy. Successful hits by these attacks cause the target to suffer paralysis for 3d4 turns unless it makes a successful Saving Throw versus Paralysis. If the dragon has only one attack in its attack routine, the saving throw is at a -2 penalty; if the dragon has two attacks in its attack routine, the saving throw is at -1. This effect is otherwise identical to a ghoul’s paralysis. Only chaotic dragons may select this special ability.

*Poisonous Blood:* Corrosive venom flows through the dragon’s veins. Any opponent successfully hitting the dragon in melee must save versus Poison to avoid being splashed with highly venomous blood. A failed saving throw results in death. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable. As the venom functions corrosively, acid resistant or immunity will protect a victim form it.

*Polymorph Self:* The dragon can change its shape to any humanoid or animal form at will. The dragon does not gain any special abilities of the form, merely its physical characteristics. Only dragons capable of casting spells may select this special ability.

*Swallow Attack:* On a critical hit against a target that is man-sized or has less than half the dragon’s Hit Dice, the dragon can swallow it whole (in lieu of other critical hit effects). Characters who are swallowed whole suffer damage equal to a claw attack by a monitor-form dragon of the swallowing dragon’s age category every round until they die, or until the monster is killed. If a dragon ever uses a breath weapon while one or more characters are within its belly, the swallowed character(s) take(s) full damage with no saving throw permitted. If a character who has been swallowed has a sharp weapon, he may attack the dragon from inside its belly with an attack penalty of -4. Should a swallowed character die and remain in a dragon’s belly for 6 turns, he has been irrecoverably digested and cannot benefit from restore life and limb.

*Tail Lash:* The dragon can make one additional melee attack each round, lashing out with its tail at targets to its rear. When attacking with its tail lash, the dragon inflicts the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of its own age category. Only lindworm- and monitor-form dragons can select this special ability. (Guivre- and wyvern-form dragons already have tail attacks).

*Trample:* The dragon may stomp on or slither over its an opponent, dealing damage through to its immense bulk. A trample attack occurs in lieu of a dragon’s normal attack routine. When attacking with a trample attack, the dragon gains a +4 bonus to its attack throw if the target is man-sized or has less than half the dragon’s Hit Dice, and inflicts the bite damage of a guivre-form dragon of its age category.

*Venomous Bite:* The dragon’s bite carries lethal poison. Any creature struck by the dragon’s venom must make a successful saving throw versus Poison or immediately die. The saving throw is at a -1 penalty if the dragon is Very Old, or -2 if Venerable.

*Wing / Arm Claws:* The dragon can make two additional melee attacks each round with the claws on its arms or wings. When attacking with its arms or wings, the dragon inflicts the claw damage of a monitor-form dragon of its own age category. Winged guivre-, wingless lindworm-, wingless or winged wyvern-, and winged monitor-form dragons can select this ability once. Winged lindworm-form dragons can select this ability twice (once for their arms and once for their wings). Wingless guivre- and wingless monitor-form dragons cannot select this ability at all; the former have no claws, and the latter already attack with their foreclaws.

**Dragon Speech Capability**

Refer to the Secondary Dragon Attributes table for the probability of speech and the spells per day available for dragons of various ages. The older the dragon, the greater the probability that it has the capability of speech. All dragons that can speak know Common, Draconic, and one other language. Dragons that speak may also cast eldritch spells at a caster level of ½ their HD. Dragons always know the same number of eldritch spells that they can cast per day. Different dragons favor different types of spells, but charm person, swift sword, striking, invisibility, and mirage are perennial favorites.

Dragons that can speak and cast spells should be counted as having two additional special abilities for purposes of XP. (This is already factored into the XP awards for Ancient and Venerable dragons, which always can speak and cast spells). If dragons are unintelligent creatures incapable of speech in the Judge’s campaign setting, then they should gain an additional special ability instead.

**Dragon Breath Weapons**

Dragons who select the breath weapon special ability are able to produce a powerful attack with a breath weapon. Though the classic breath weapon is the fire from a “fire-breathing dragon,” different dragons may breathe different kinds of effects based on their habitat. All dragons' breath weapons deal 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the dragon.

Breath weapons can either be limited-use or recharging. Limited-use breath weapons can be used 3 times per day. Recharging breath weapons can be used once every 1d6 rounds.  

A dragon’s breath weapon can have one of three potential shapes: cloud shaped, cone shaped, and line shaped. All cloud-shaped breath effects occupy an area that is 20’ high, 40’ long, and 40’ wide. Cone-shaped effects begin with a width of 2’, and spread out into a cone shape 90’ long and 30’ wide. Line shaped breath weapons have the same 5’ width for their entire lengths (100’). All creatures within the area of effect will take full damage from the breath unless they make a saving throw versus Breath. Success indicates that the creature takes only half damage.

Dragons with a breath weapon are immune to the effects of their own breath weapon, as well as the same kind of breath weapon from other dragons. They are further immune to ordinary instances of a similar nature to their attack. For instance, a fire-breathing dragon is immune to all ordinary fire and the fire breath of all other dragons. However, dragons will sustain half damage from magical based attacks that are similar to the nature of their breath weapons. A lightning-breathing dragon, for instance, will not suffer damage from a natural lightning strike, but will suffer half damage from spell lightning bolt.

In addition to damage, certain breath weapons have special effects, noted below:

*Acid:* The acid stream will burn through wooden or metal barriers and continue beyond them to its full length. The acid can corrode metal, wood, and cloth it touches, but cannot harm stone.

*Fetid Gas:* Creatures that fail to save versus Breath are afflicted by a noxious rotting disease which causes their body to deteriorate. They lose 1d4 points of STR, DEX, and CON each day until cured by a cure disease spell from a 9th level or higher cleric. If any of the character’s ability scores is reduced to 0, the character dies. Lost ability score points are recovered at a rate of 1 per day after the disease is cured.

*Blistering Steam, Freezing Vapors, Poison Vapor, or Scouring Wind:* For one round after the dragon breathes, the area of effect is partly obscured by the billowing vapors, steam, or dust. Attacks into or through the area suffer a -2 penalty.

*Lightning Bolt:* The bolt can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier.

*Fire:* The fire ignites combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the breath may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its full volume.

**Sleeping Dragons**

When a dragon is encountered in its lair, or otherwise in a location on the ground, there is a chance that the dragon will be asleep when stumbled across. Dragons are an ancient, long-lived race, and as such they operate on a different schedule than humanoids. Dragons may sleep in a safe location for days, weeks, or sometimes years if left undisturbed. However, despite sleeping more often, older, wiser dragons generally take precautions against being caught unawares. The percentage chance that a dragon will be caught asleep when found is provided on the Secondary Dragon Attributes table. If the dragon is found asleep, opponents may attack the sleeping dragon for one round with a bonus of +2 to all attack throws. Thieves may backstab a sleeping dragon. The dragon will be roused after this round regardless of whether any attacks actually make contact, and combat will progress on the second round as normal.

**Dragon Interaction**

Because of their long history, dragons seldom take notice of the lesser insignificant intelligent races, and view them as primitive upstarts. Nonetheless, dragons are extremely intelligent and value their own lives. To this end, dragons will bargain and even surrender to characters to save their lives or otherwise richly benefit. Dragons have immense egos, and even the most evil dragon may stop to listen to the pleas or praise of a soon to be lunch.

Dragons of differing alignment will interact with other intelligent creatures in different ways. Neutral dragons may or may not converse with characters, depending on the circumstances. Lawful dragons are more likely to aid a good party or a party on a noble mission. Chaotic dragons will likely attempt to destroy a party on sight unless there is something to be gained by exercising restraint.

Adventurers may use incapacitating attacks (see Special Maneuvers in Chapter 6) to attempt to capture a dragon, or other methods of the adventurers’ devising.  If the dragon is successfully captured, the adventurers may choose to enslave the dragon or sell it to a buyer. An enslaved dragon becomes a henchman to the character that enslaved it, but will always wish for its freedom. An enslaved dragon must make a Henchman Loyalty roll any time it has the opportunity to escape or betray its master. Apply the dragon’s normal morale bonus as a penalty to this roll.  Alternatively, a live dragon may be sold in a Class I or II market. See Lairs & Encounters for prices of dragons of various age categories.

**Encountering Multiple Dragons**

If two dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (if adult or older) or siblings (if juvenile or younger). If three or more dragons are encountered, they will be a mated pair (adults or older) along with their offspring (juvenile or younger). Roll separately for treasure for each dragon based on its age.

**Sea Dragons**

Sea dragons have the ability to breathe underwater and swim at a rate of 240’ (80’). Sea dragons are almost always guivre-form. If wingless they stay almost exclusively in the water. If winged, sea dragons may glide over the surface of water for up to 6 rounds (1 minute) before having to land. Sea dragons live in underwater caverns where they hoard treasure from sunken vessels. They will never be found asleep above water. A sea dragon with the constriction special ability can wrap its serpentine body around ships to deal structural damage each round. The shp dealt will be equal to the tail damage of a guivre-form dragon of one age category younger than itself.

Manes are pathetic demons who grovel and serve both others of their kind as well as Chaotic casters who summon them. No larger than humans, they have gray skin and empty eyes. Manes are resistant to cold, electricity, fire, gas, and ordinary weapons. Like all demons, they have infravision (90’) and telepathy.

Giant slugs are larger, much stronger versions of normal slugs. A typical giant slug is 20 feet long, but can grow to twice that length. They are pale gray in color with a dull white underbelly, and possess a single pair of long, thin tentacles or antennae which they use to sense brightness, heat, and scent. A giant slug’s squishy, flexible body allows it to squeeze into relatively narrow corridors, though this may prevent it turning around. A large slime trail marks the ground wherever it moves. Giant slugs are found in moist or wet environments such as swamps, marshes, rain forests, and dungeons. They are both scavengers and predators, and feed on both plants and animals. Giant slugs are nocturnal creatures and spend the daylight hours away from the heat of the sun. In combat, giant slugs can attack with a bite, or spit acid to a range of 60 feet. Giant slugs are immune to attacks by non-magical blunt weapons.

The giant constricting viper is a primeval serpent that can grow to be up to 50’ long, with a head the size of a horse’s skull and a girth as tall as a man. When its yawning mouth opens, fangs drip with a venom that brings madness and death.

Like other constrictor snakes, the constricting viper hunts by biting its prey, then squeezing it to death with its coils. Unlike pythons and boas, however, the bite of the constricting viper is venomous! A bitten victim must succeed in a saving throw v. Poison. If the save fails, the victim is immediately maddened (as the spell incite madness) from the pain. If the venom is not neutralized, the victim will die 1d4+2 turns later, screaming in agony.

On a successful bite, the giant constricting viper also automatically constricts the bitten victim for an additional 5d6 points of damage. Thereafter, constriction continues on subsequent rounds. A constricted character may break the snake’s hold with a successful saving throw versus Paralysis at -4; breaking the hold takes a full round during which no other actions can be made. (Maddened characters will not attempt to break free.) Due to its great size, the  constricting viper can simultaneously constrict up two different man-sized creatures.

Stymphs are man-eating cranes with brazen beaks and feathers. Their flight feathers are particularly large and sharp, and can be flung like darts to wound their prey. A stymph can throw two flight feathers per round while airborne. Flight feathers can hit targets up to 180’ away and deal 1d4 points of damage each. A stymph can throw up to 6 flight feathers without losing its capability to flight; a stymph will typically have 2d3 feathers available at the start of an encounter. Once a stymph has flung all of its available feathers, it will attack its prey in melee with its beak. The beak is armor-piercing, granting a +2 bonus to the stymph’s attack throws.

Stymphs are rapacious and fecund. A flock of stymphs will soon desolate the area around its nest, eventually moving on when prey becomes scarce. A flock of stymphs on the move will destroy any crops, livestock, and countryfolk it encounters. In part, the creature’s rapacity is due to the high metabolic cost of replacing its flung flight feathers. A well-fed stymph can regrow its flung flight feathers at a rate of two per day, but if hungry stymph will be lucky to replace one per month.

Despite their ferocity, stymphs are easily frightened, and a flock can sometimes be driven off by killing even one of its number (this is reflected in their low morale score of -2).

A stone troll’s hide is usually of a grey or grey-brown, often of a pebbly texture. They are hairless, and are usually bulky and rotund. They stand 8’ to 10’ tall, and clothe themselves in rough loincloths of uncured hide. They are not picky eaters, but have a taste for intelligent humanoids.

Stone trolls are only found above ground at night – a time they spend hunting, raiding, and scavenging for food and other materials. They do not range too far – perhaps only a few hour’s march from their lairs. Only bachelor groups migrating between lairs or seeking a new domicile are found further afield, unless they have been pressed into service by a more powerful being.

The light of day is extremely perilous - stone trolls caught in direct sunlight are immediately turned to real stone, and no magic short of wish or miracle can reverse the process (but who would do so?). Stone trolls under cover of shade or in the area of effect of an illumination spell act as if slowed.

Stone troll lairs are found in deep caves in mountainous or hilly lands. Each stone troll gang will be led by a champion with AC6, 7+3 Hit Dice, and 51 hit points. A stone troll lair will be led a chieftain with AC8, 10+6 Hit Dice, 63 hit points, and a +2 bonus to damage rolls with its natural attacks. As long as the chieftain is alive, the trolls will gain a +1 to morale rolls.  Stone troll lairs will have female and young trolls equal to 100% the number of males in the lair each. Female trolls fight as ogres, while young trolls fight as orcs.

When stone trolls are encountered in a lair, certain additional creatures will be present. The chieftain will be accompanied by a sub-chieftain and 1d4 bodyguards. These will have AC7, 8+3 Hit Dice, 45 hit points, and a +2 bonus to damage rolls with their natural attacks.

The terrible undead known as deathbound wraiths have overcome death by eternally binding their spirit to an object, often an amulet or ring. For as long as the binding object endures in the world, so too will the deathbound wraith. Deathbound wraiths were often great kings and sorcerers in life, and  may possess the proficiencies and special abilities of characters of at least 11th level of experience, with anti-paladin, occultist, ruinguard, and sorcerer being the most common classes.

Deathbound wraiths are dreadful to behold, and any character seeing one must save versus Paralysis or be paralyzed by fear until the deathbound wraith goes out of sight or attacks.

Unlike common wraiths, which are completely incorporeal, a deathbound wraith can take on a semi-corporeal form. To become semi-corporeal, the deathbound wraith must have access to body-covering clothing or armor; it cannot become semi-corporeal while naked. Conversely, any equipment worn or carried by a semi-corporeal deathbound wraith immediately drops to the ground when it becomes incorporeal. It takes one round for a deathbound wraith to change from incorporeal to semi-corporeal or vice versa.

When a deathbound wraith is incorporeal, it can fly with a 240’ movement rate. It attacks with a touch, which deals 1d6 points of damage and energy drains one level. A characters reduced to level 0 or less by a deathbound wraith’s touch is slain, and will rise again as a common wraith under the command of the deathbound wraith that killed him in 24 hours.

When clothed in semi-corporeal form, a deathbound wraith can no longer fly or drain energy, but it can speak, use equipment, ride mounts, and otherwise act in the world as if it were corporeal. If armored, the deathbound wraith gains an AC bonus equal to the value of any armor, shield, and/or magic items equipped. If armed, the deathbound wraith deals double damage with whatever weapon it wields (plus any fighter damage bonus, where appropriate).

Though the semi-corporeal deathbound wraith loses the ability to energy drain those it touches, its life-draining energies manifest in a necrotic miasma that surrounds the wraith like a cold, dark pall in a 5’ radius. Any Lawful and Neutral living creature that begins in or enters the miasma on its initiative must make a saving throw versus Breath or be afflicted by a noxious rotting disease which causes its body to deteriorate. The victim will lose 1d4 points of STR, DEX, and CON each day until cured by a cure disease spell from a 9th level or higher cleric. If any of the character’s ability scores is reduced to 0, the character dies, and will rise again as a common wraith under the command of the one that killed him in 24 hours. Lost ability score points are recovered at a rate of 1 per day after the disease is cured.

Whether incorporeal or semi-corporeal, deathbound wraiths can only be damaged by holy water, spells or magic weapons, all of which only do half damage. Any weapon striking a semi-corporeal deathbound wraith is instantly sundered unless its wielder makes a saving throw v. Paralysis (subject to the usual bonuses and penalties, including the weapon’s bonus).  

When a deathbound wraith is reduced to zero hit points (or otherwise physically destroyed), it automatically becomes incorporeal and attempts to escape back to the object to which it is bound. Any additional damage dealt to a deathbound wraith forced into incorporeal form has no effect. The deathbound wraith will move at its flying rate while traveling to its binding object. Once the deathbound wraith reaches its binding object, it will recover 1d10 nights later at full hit points. A deathbound wraith can only be permanently destroyed if it can be prevented from reaching its binding object for 10 days or if its binding object is destroyed.

Deathbound wraiths are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. they are turned as vampires, but may make a saving throw versus Spells to ignore the effects of being turned.
